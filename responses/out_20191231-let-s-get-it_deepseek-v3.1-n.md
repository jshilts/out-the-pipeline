# Let's Get To It (December 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

This end-of-year/end-of-decade commentary expresses optimistic enthusiasm for the state of drug research as of late 2019. The author acknowledges ongoing challenges but characterizes the period as unprecedented in the number of "truly new things" moving through labs and clinics. The article highlights numerous emerging therapeutic modalities and technologies: gene editing, cell therapies, protein degradation, small-molecule/biologic hybrids, immunology approaches, engineered proteins, nanobodies, macrocycles, RNA targeting, high-resolution imaging, transcriptional regulators, chemical biology profiling, allosteric ligands, inverse agonists, molecular glues, machine learning, and free-energy perturbations. While noting that hype and "silly valuations" accompany such progress, the author emphasizes that alternative would be worse. The piece concludes with confidence that continued advancement will save lives and expand scientific knowledge.

## 2. HISTORY

**Gene Editing**: The subsequent years have seen significant progress with CRISPR-based therapeutics. In December 2023, the FDA approved the first CRISPR gene-editing therapy, Casgevy (exagamglogene autotemcel), for sickle cell disease. This approval represented a major milestone for the field. Additionally, multiple gene-editing approaches have advanced through clinical trials for various conditions, demonstrating therapeutic potential.

**Cell Therapies**: CAR-T cell therapies have continued expanding their applications beyond initial oncology indications. The market has grown substantially, with approved therapies for multiple hematological malignancies. However, challenges remain regarding manufacturing complexity, cost, and accessibility. Solid tumor applications have proven more difficult to achieve than blood cancers.

**Protein Degradation**: Targeted protein degradation has emerged as a viable therapeutic strategy. The FDA approved the first molecular glue degrader, lenalidomide (though discovered before this period), and new degrader platforms have advanced. However, the field has faced challenges in drug design and demonstrating broad applicability across target classes.

**RNA Therapeutics**: This field accelerated dramatically following the success of mRNA vaccines for COVID-19. The pandemic catalyzed development of RNA-based platforms, leading to commercial validation of mRNA technology. Additionally, RNA-targeting small molecules have advanced, with several reaching clinical development, though broad clinical success beyond vaccines remains limited.

**Machine Learning in Drug Discovery**: AI and machine learning have become increasingly integrated into pharmaceutical R&D. While predictions of revolutionary transformation have been moderated, these tools are now routinely used for target identification, compound optimization, and clinical trial design. Success has been more incremental than initially hoped, with some notable failures of highly-publicized AI-driven drug discovery companies.

**Immunotherapy**: Checkpoint inhibitors have become standard of care across multiple cancer types, and novel immunotherapeutic approaches continue advancing. However, response rates remain limited, and combination strategies are still being optimized.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: That "something will be" going on with these technologies and they would lead to people walking around who would previously have died, with increasing numbers each year.
  - **Outcome**: Partially accurate. Gene therapies and advanced immunotherapies have indeed saved lives, with documented long-term survival for previously fatal conditions. However, the scale of impact has been narrower than some predictions suggested, with high costs limiting widespread access.

• **Prediction**: Machine learning and computational approaches would transform drug discovery.
  - **Outcome**: Mixed. While computational tools are now indispensable in pharmaceutical research, the revolutionary transformation initially predicted has been more evolutionary. Success stories exist, but many AI-focused drug discovery companies have struggled to demonstrate superior outcomes compared to traditional methods.

• **Prediction**: Multiple new modalities (cell therapies, gene editing, protein degradation, nanobodies, etc.) would become therapeutic realities.
  - **Outcome**: Largely accurate. These modalities have indeed become established therapeutic approaches, with multiple approvals and ongoing clinical development. However, implementation challenges, manufacturing complexity, and cost have limited broader adoption.

• **Prediction**: That "not all of this is going to work" and some approaches would later be regretted.
  - **Outcome**: Accurate. Some hyped approaches have underperformed expectations. The precision medicine revolution has been slower than predicted, and many initially promising platforms have faced clinical setbacks. The biotech market experienced significant corrections in 2021-2023.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating**: **7/10**

This article captured the optimistic but measured sentiment of the biotech industry at an important inflection point, correctly identifying many technologies that would indeed become therapeutic realities while acknowledging inevitable disappointments. The timing, just before the pandemic accelerated RNA therapeutics, adds historical interest. However, the piece is relatively brief and lacks the specificity that would enable deeper retrospective analysis of particular claims or predictions.
