# Artificial Intelligence, You Say? (October 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques a Telegraph story about Berg Pharmaceuticals claiming to have "halved cancer drug development time thanks to artificial intelligence." The drug in question, BPM31510, is actually a liposomal formulation of Coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone), a naturally occurring compound extensively studied for decades and widely available as a supplement. Berg's approach involves using AI to analyze massive datasets (14 trillion data points per tissue sample) to compare cancerous versus non-cancerous tissues, focusing on proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic profiles. The drug targets the Warburg effect in cancer metabolism, though the mechanism remains debated. At publication, BPM31510 was in Phase I trials, with a previously attempted topical formulation for squamous cell carcinoma having completed Phase II five years prior without apparent progress.

## 2. HISTORY

After the article's publication, Berg's story took several significant turns:

**Clinical Development (2015-2020):**  
BPM31510 progressed through multiple Phase I and Phase II trials for various cancers including pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, and advanced solid tumors. By 2017, the company had initiated a Phase II trial for pancreatic cancer - a disease area where Berg had emphasized their AI-driven approach would show particular promise.

**Corporate Restructuring (2020):**  
In 2020, Berg LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company had burned through approximately $673 million in funding while failing to advance any drug to Phase III trials or FDA approval. The extensive AI platform and "14 trillion data points" approach had not produced the promised breakthrough.

**Asset Sale and Reinvention (2021):**  
Berg's assets were acquired by South Korean pharmaceutical company Celltrion for $54 million in 2021 - less than 8% of the total funding raised. The deal included BPM31510 and associated clinical data, but notably not the core AI platform that had been heavily promoted. The company rebranded as Berg Health and shifted focus away from the AI-driven approach under new ownership.

**Clinical Outcomes:**  
BPM31510 failed to demonstrate significant efficacy in trials. No version of the drug received FDA approval, despite early claims of halved development timelines. The clinical trials database shows completed Phase I and II studies with no subsequent Phase III trials initiated, indicating lack of sufficient efficacy signals to justify further development.

**Broader Trend:**  
Berg's experience reflects a wider pattern in the pharmaceutical industry where "AI-platform" companies struggled to deliver on promises. The period saw numerous biotechs emphasize computational approaches but encountered the same fundamental challenges as traditional drug development: biology is complex, and finding effective therapies remains difficult regardless of analytical methodology.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **"Cancer drug development time halved"**: This central claim proved entirely false. Development did not proceed faster than conventional approaches, with BPM31510 failing to advance beyond early clinical phases over a decade-long development timeline.
  
- **"Artificial intelligence will identify effective targets"**: The AI platform failed to identify a viable drug candidate or produce an approved therapy, with the company ultimately abandoning the computational focus through bankruptcy and asset sale.

- **Implicit prediction of successful therapeutic outcomes**: The company's confidence in their supercomputer-capability approach suggested successful drug development was imminent, but no drug emerged from their efforts.

- **Implicit prediction of a "data-driven" breakthrough**: While the concept of big data in medicine has shown value in other contexts, Berg's specific implementation failed to translate massive datasets into clinical success.

## 4. INTEREST

**Decile Score: 7**

This article demonstrates remarkable prescience in identifying the AI hype cycle and provides a case study in how computational claims can mask fundamentally flawed drug development strategies. It serves as an important historical marker for the intersection of AI marketing and pharmaceutical reality.
