# A (Sad) Look Back to 2006 At GSK (December 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article looks back at 2006 predictions made by GlaxoSmithKline CEO Jean-Pierre Garnier about the company's future trajectory. Garnier had declared that GSK's ramp-up in R&D investment would make it "the Microsoft of the pharmaceuticals industry," stepping away from competition through research intensity.

The vision centered on three key elements: (1) major revenue growth from three upcoming blockbuster drugs—Cervarix (cervical cancer vaccine), Tykerb (oral breast cancer treatment), and Eltrombopag/Promacta (blood clotting agent); (2) dramatically increasing R&D spending from $4.4 billion (16% of revenues) in 2006 to 20-25% of revenues within a decade; (3) becoming the dominant R&D leader in pharmaceuticals. The article uses 2014 hindsight to assess how these predictions actually played out eight years later.

## 2. HISTORY

By 2014, the grand vision had significantly underperformed expectations:

**Drug Performance (2013 revenues):**
- **Tykerb (lapatinib)**: Generated approximately $340 million, significantly below blockbuster expectations. The drug faced disappointing clinical trial results and failed to demonstrate superiority over Roche's Herceptin, leading GSK to halt parts of breast cancer trials in 2011.
- **Cervarix**: Brought in $270 million (down 37% year-over-year), with most of the decline attributed to trouble in the Japanese market.
- **Eltrombopag/Promacta**: The relative bright spot with $307 million (up 46%), though still far from blockbuster territory.
- Combined revenues for all three drugs totaled barely over $900 million—less than a single blockbuster drug typically generates, and far below the "billions" predicted.

**R&D Investment:**
GSK's actual R&D spending in 2014 was 15% of overall revenues—not only failing to reach the target 20-25% range but actually declining from the 16% baseline in 2006. The company was in the process of implementing further cuts, making any near-term increase toward the ambitious target impossible.

**Corporate Outcomes:**
The much-hyped "Microsoft of pharmaceuticals" vision never materialized. Instead of dramatically outpacing competitors, GSK was preparing for major reorganization in 2014, with expectations of additional R&D cuts on the horizon. The gap between the ambitious 2006 predictions and 2014 reality highlighted broader challenges in pharmaceutical R&D productivity during this period.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **"Microsoft of pharmaceuticals" dominance through R&D intensity**: ✗ **Failed** - GSK remained second-largest drug company without achieving the promised separation from competition; R&D spending actually declined as a percentage of revenue

- **Tykerb becoming a blockbuster breast cancer drug**: ✗ **Failed** - Reached only $340 million in 2013 revenues while facing clinical trial disappointments and failing to show superiority over existing treatments

- **Cervarix as a major revenue driver**: ✗ **Failed** - Generated only $270 million (down 37%) rather than billions, with significant market challenges particularly in Japan

- **Eltrombopag achieving blockbuster status**: ✗ **Failed** - Despite being the best performer at $307 million, it fell well short of blockbuster ($1B+) threshold

- **R&D spending reaching 20-25% of revenues within a decade**: ✗ **Failed** - Actual spending dropped to 15% of revenues, with further cuts planned

- **Billions in combined revenue from these three drugs**: ✗ **Failed** - Total combined revenue barely exceeded $900 million, less than a single typical blockbuster drug

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 6/9**

This article provides a valuable reality check on pharmaceutical industry hubris and the persistent gap between ambitious corporate predictions and actual R&D outcomes. The stark contrast between 2006's confident pronouncements and 2014's disappointing results makes it a useful case study in drug development uncertainty.
