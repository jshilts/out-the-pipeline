# Med-Chem Video Finalists (August 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The European Federation for Medicinal Chemistry (EFMC) launched a video competition titled "Why Medicinal Chemistry?" to promote awareness of the field. By August 2015, the competition had narrowed to six finalists, and the organization was soliciting public votes through their website to determine the winning entry. The initiative represented an outreach effort to communicate the value and importance of medicinal chemistry to broader audiences through short video formats.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2015 competition, the EFMC has continued various outreach and educational initiatives over the subsequent years. The organization maintains an active presence in promoting medicinal chemistry across Europe through conferences (such as the EFMC International Symposium on Medicinal Chemistry), awards programs, and educational activities. However, the specific impact of this particular video competition is difficult to assess without access to voting results, winner information, or measurable outcomes related to public engagement or recruitment into the field. The voting link referenced in the article (http://www.efmc.info/videos-poll.php) appears to no longer be active, which is typical for time-limited online polls from that era.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments in biotechnology or medicinal chemistry. It was purely an announcement about an ongoing video competition and a call for public participation in voting. As such, there are no predictions to evaluate against subsequent events.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

This article describes a pharmaceutical industry association video competition announcement with minimal broader scientific or industry significance. While promotional efforts for scientific fields serve important outreach functions, this specific content's relevance is limited to a narrow time window and audience.

*Note: This analysis is constrained by the lack of access to external databases and the specific voting results or competition outcomes that would provide more substantive evaluation of the initiative's impact.*
