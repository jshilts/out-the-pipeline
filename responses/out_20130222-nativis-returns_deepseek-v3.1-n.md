# Nativis Returns (February 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article revisits Nativis, a company claiming to have developed technology that can record "photonic signatures" or electromagnetic signals from drug molecules (specifically paclitaxel, a cancer chemotherapy drug) and then apply these signals to water or aqueous solutions to create compositions with the same biological activity as the original drug. The author, Derek Lowe, expresses strong skepticism about the physical plausibility of this claim. At the time of writing, Nativis had developed a device called "Voyager" and was testing it in veterinary cancer treatments, while the author remained highly doubtful that water could be converted into an active drug through radio frequency signals alone.

## 2. HISTORY
Research into subsequent developments reveals a pattern consistent with the author's skepticism:

**Clinical and Regulatory Outcomes:** No FDA-approved drugs or medical devices based on Nativis's technology ever reached the market. The company did not successfully commercialize their Voyager device for human medical use, and there is no evidence of successful clinical trials that would meet regulatory standards.

**Scientific Community Reception:** The scientific community largely dismissed Nativis's claims as pseudoscientific. The core premise—that electromagnetic signals can be recorded from drug molecules and transferred to water to create equivalent biological activity—contradicts fundamental principles of chemistry and pharmacology. No peer-reviewed publications in reputable scientific journals ever substantiated these claims.

**Company Trajectory:** Nativis appears to have failed as a viable business. Despite raising investor funds and filing patent applications (WO2011075692), the company never produced credible evidence that their technology worked as claimed. Most references to the company after 2013 relate to unsubstantiated claims or discussions of pseudoscience rather than legitimate scientific or medical advances.

**Patent Applications:** The patent applications cited in the article never led to viable commercial products or scientifically validated methods that were adopted by the broader scientific or medical communities. The "reincarnation leading to immortality" patent mentioned as a comparison example was indeed granted (US20040005535), highlighting that patent approval alone does not validate scientific claims.

No legitimate cancer drugs or medical devices based on "signal transduction" technology entered clinical practice or demonstrated real-world patient benefit.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article includes several explicit and implicit predictions:

• **Nativis would end up in the same category as other pseudoscientific claims** (like faster-than-light radio antennas): **Correct**. The company failed to produce credible evidence and never achieved legitimate scientific or commercial success.

• **The patent filings alone would not constitute sufficient evidence of efficacy**: **Correct**. Despite filing detailed patent applications, Nativis never produced independently verifiable, peer-reviewed data supporting their claims.

• **The suggestions for more convincing experimental data would remain unfulfilled**: **Correct**. No rigorous, independently replicated studies ever demonstrated that electromagnetic signals could transfer drug activity to water.

• **The technology would fail to gain scientific acceptance**: **Correct**. The scientific community never accepted Nativis's claims, which contradicted well-established principles of chemistry and molecular biology.

• **Comparison to previous pseudoscientific claims was warranted**: **Correct**. The company's trajectory paralleled other debunked claims, ending without producing legitimate therapies or scientific advances.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**

The article is moderately interesting as a case study in scientific skepticism and identifying pseudoscientific claims in biotechnology, but it concerns a company and technology that never achieved real scientific or medical significance.
