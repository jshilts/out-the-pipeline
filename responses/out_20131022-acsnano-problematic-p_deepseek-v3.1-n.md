# ACSNano on Problematic Papers (October 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

In October 2013, ACS Nano's editorial board published an editorial statement addressing how the journal should handle problematic papers with questionable content. This appears to have been prompted by a recent controversy involving a paper containing what was described as "ridiculously Photoshopped" nanorod images that had been published in the journal. The editors proposed that when readers identify questionable content, they should first contact the journal directly rather than publicly discussing concerns on blogs or social media. The journal would then conduct a formal investigation, offering authors the chance to respond, with potential outcomes including corrections, retractions, or notifications to authors' institutions. The editorial emphasized maintaining a climate of trust, cautioning against assuming competitors' work is potentially wrong, and discouraging anonymous public criticism. The original commentary argues against this approach, advocating instead for open public discussion of published papers, viewing such scrutiny as inherent to the scientific process and beneficial for maintaining paper quality.

## 2. HISTORY

The ACS Nano editorial of 2013 emerged during a period of growing tension between traditional scientific publishing models and the expanding influence of post-publication peer review platforms. In subsequent years, several key developments reshaped how the scientific community addresses problematic papers:

**Rise of Post-Publication Peer Review**: Platforms like PubPeer, founded in 2012 and gaining significant traction by 2013-2014, became increasingly influential venues for discussing and identifying problems in published papers. Rather than following the ACS Nano model of private complaints to journals first, scientists increasingly used these platforms for immediate public discussion of concerns.

**Continued High-Profile Retractions**: Between 2013 and 2023, major retractions continued across scientific publishing, including numerous cases where public discussion on blogs and social media preceded formal journal action. The approach ACS Nano advocated—keeping concerns private during investigation—increasingly conflicted with scientists' desire for transparency and rapid dissemination of concerns about potentially flawed research.

**Evolution of Journal Policies**: Many journals gradually adopted more transparent approaches to handling concerns, with some implementing systems that allow for public comments or "expression of concern" notices while investigations proceed, rather than the complete silence ACS Nano initially advocated.

**Growth of Scientific Integrity Focus**: The years following 2013 saw increased institutional and funding agency attention to research integrity, with more systematic approaches to investigating misconduct, though concerns about the speed and transparency of these processes remained.

However, **no major shift in overall retraction rates or systemic reforms** resulted specifically from this editorial. The broader scientific publishing landscape continued grappling with how to balance authors' rights to respond with the scientific community's need for rapid information about potentially problematic papers.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original commentary made several implicit predictions about the future of scientific discourse:

• **Prediction**: That wide-open discussion of papers' merits would become more common and beneficial for science.
  **Outcome**: **Substantially accurate**. Post-publication peer review platforms grew significantly, with PubPeer becoming an established part of scientific discourse. However, debates continue about the appropriate balance between immediate public criticism and giving authors/journals time to investigate.

• **Prediction**: That results capable of standing up to public scrutiny would become more valued, while shaky results would be increasingly exposed.
  **Outcome**: **Mixed success**. While high-profile cases did get exposed through public discussion, many questionable papers remained undetected or unaddressed, and the overall volume of retractions increased rather than decreased in subsequent years.

• **Prediction**: That ACS Nano's call for private complaints first, followed by silence during investigation, would not be widely adopted.
  **Outcome**: **Accurate**. Most scientific discourse moved in the opposite direction, toward greater transparency and more immediate public discussion of concerns.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 4/10**

The editorial represents an interesting historical moment in the tension between traditional journal authority and emerging transparent scientific discourse, but its specific controversy was relatively narrow and its proposed solution was largely overtaken by broader trends favoring post-publication peer review transparency, limiting its long-term significance.

## 5. REFLECTION

Looking back, this editorial captures a transitional moment in scientific publishing. The ACS Nano editors were attempting to maintain traditional journal authority and due process for accused authors, reflecting legitimate concerns about protecting scientists from potentially unfair public accusations. However, the approach they advocated—keeping concerns confidential until investigations conclude—proved impractical and increasingly unpopular as scientists demanded more transparency and faster responses to potentially problematic research.

The tension ACS Nano identified was real: balancing thorough, fair investigation with the scientific community's need to know about potentially flawed research. But the solution they proposed underestimated both the feasibility of maintaining confidentiality in the internet age and the scientific community's appetite for immediate, open discussion of concerns.

The subsequent growth of PubPeer and similar platforms demonstrated that while the concerns ACS Nano raised about fairness and due process were valid, the scientific community largely concluded that the benefits of transparent post-publication review outweighed the risks of occasional unfair criticism. However, it's worth noting that debates continue about how best to handle these situations, particularly regarding anonymous accusations and the appropriate speed of response, suggesting that ACS Nano's editorial identified enduring challenges even if its proposed solutions were not widely adopted.
