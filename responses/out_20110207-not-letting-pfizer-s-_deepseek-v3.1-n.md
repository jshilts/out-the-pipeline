# Not Letting Pfizer's UK Site Go to Waste? (February 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses efforts to prevent the complete loss of Pfizer's UK research site in Sandwich, Kent, which was facing closure with 2,400 job cuts. George Freeman, a Conservative MP and biotech expert, was leading an initiative to bring venture capitalists and biotech angel investors to rescue parts of the site. The plan involved collaborating with prominent UK entrepreneurs including Hermann Hauser (founder of Acorn Computers) and serial biotech businessman Andy Richards to help Pfizer scientists transition their expertise into spin-out companies or similar ventures. The article expresses hope for the initiative while acknowledging the practical challenges of launching such efforts after a closure announcement and recognizing that even successful outcomes would employ fewer people than the original facility.

## 2. HISTORY

The Pfizer Sandwich site closure became a reality, with operations winding down significantly by 2012-2013. However, parts of Freeman's vision did materialize through the creation of the **Discovery Park** enterprise. The site was repurposed as a science and technology park housing multiple smaller biotech and life sciences companies rather than remaining a single large pharmaceutical research facility.

Several notable developments emerged from this transition:

- **Discovery Park** became a successful multi-tenant science park with over 150 companies and 2,500+ people working on site by 2023, representing a different employment model than the original single-employer setup.
- Multiple smaller biotech and drug discovery companies did establish operations at the site, though employment numbers never reached the original Pfizer levels.
- The transition reflected broader industry trends of large pharma companies consolidating R&D sites while smaller, more agile biotech companies filled some gaps.
- George Freeman later became UK Life Sciences Minister (2014-2016) and continued advocating for UK biotech sector growth.

The Sandwich site's transformation demonstrated that large pharma site closures could be partially mitigated through cluster-based regeneration, though the outcome involved fundamentally different business models and employment structures than the original proposal envisioned.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction**: That venture capitalists and biotech angels could save "as many of the 2,400 jobs as possible" through spin-outs and similar ventures.
  - **Reality**: While the site was successfully repurposed as Discovery Park with eventual employment recovery to similar levels (2,500+ workers), this occurred through a multi-company cluster model rather than direct job preservation. The employment structure and timeline differed significantly from immediate job rescue.

- **Prediction**: The effort would be "difficult" to get off the ground after closure announcement.
  - **Reality**: Accurate. The transition took several years and required significant investment and public-private coordination to establish the science park infrastructure.

- **Prediction**: Even at their best, such efforts "won't be able to keep as many people discovering drugs as the old site did."
  - **Reality**: Partially accurate. The total number of drug discovery scientists employed at the site likely decreased initially and never returned to Pfizer-era levels of concentrated R&D, though the diversified science park model created different types of scientific employment.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article captures an important moment in pharmaceutical industry restructuring and UK science policy, with the Sandwich case becoming a notable example of post-closure site regeneration. The long-term success of Discovery Park and Freeman's subsequent policy influence make this historically significant for understanding biotech cluster development.
