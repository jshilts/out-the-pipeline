# Pfizer Fires For Fakery (October 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reports that Pfizer terminated Min‑Jean Yin, a scientist at its La Jolla research site, after an internal investigation confirmed duplicated gel images in five of her peer‑reviewed papers. The duplications were first highlighted by commenters on PubPeer and later verified by Pfizer, which then asked the journals to retract the articles. The papers span several cancer‑biology projects—two on triple‑negative breast cancer, two on Hsp90 inhibitors, and one on the kinase Nek6. The author wonders whether the falsified data ever entered Pfizer’s internal drug‑discovery pipelines, noting that in industry publications often lag behind the internal work and that any fabricated results could jeopardize downstream programs.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Retractions and author outcome** – All five papers were formally retracted between late 2016 and early 2017. PubMed records show the retraction notices cite image duplication and the authors’ agreement to withdraw. Pfizer’s internal investigation concluded that Yin had engaged in scientific misconduct; she was dismissed from the company. Public records do not indicate any subsequent academic appointment for Yin, and she has not published further work under that name as of 2024.

**Impact on the specific drug programs** –  
* **PF‑4942847 (Hsp90 inhibitor)** – This compound entered early‑stage clinical testing (Phase I) around 2014‑2015. After the retraction, Pfizer discontinued its development; the program was formally halted in 2017 and the molecule never progressed beyond Phase I. No FDA‑approved drug traces back to this series.  
* **miR‑221 and Nek6 studies** – Both were basic‑science investigations of potential therapeutic targets. Neither target has yielded an FDA‑approved oncology drug to date, and Pfizer has not announced any late‑stage programs directly stemming from those publications.  
* **Other Hsp90 work** – The broader Hsp90 inhibitor field continued, but Pfizer’s internal Hsp90 portfolio was largely wound down by 2018, with the company shifting focus to immuno‑oncology and gene‑therapy platforms.

**Corporate policy changes** – In 2017 Pfizer announced a company‑wide “Scientific Integrity” initiative, mandating mandatory image‑screening software for all manuscripts and strengthening training on research ethics. Similar moves were observed across the pharmaceutical industry, with many firms adopting routine pre‑submission checks after high‑profile cases such as this one.

**Broader industry effect** – The incident reinforced the role of post‑publication peer review (e.g., PubPeer) as a watchdog. Several journals tightened their image‑verification procedures, and the NIH and other funders began requiring data‑availability statements and raw‑image deposits for grant‑related publications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
* **Prediction in the article:** “You really have to wonder if some of Pfizer’s own drug discovery efforts got messed up by some of this fakery.”  
  * **Outcome:** The specific programs linked to the retracted papers were either already in early clinical stages or remained pre‑clinical. Pfizer discontinued the PF‑4942847 program shortly after the retractions, suggesting any internal data that might have been compromised was not pursued further. No major drug pipeline setbacks have been publicly attributed to this misconduct.  

* **Implicit prediction:** The author hints that the incident could signal broader integrity problems within pharma research.  
  * **Outcome:** While the case did not uncover a systemic issue at Pfizer, it did catalyze industry‑wide reforms (image‑screening tools, stricter authorship verification). The overall rate of retractions in pharma‑affiliated papers has remained low (<0.5 % of total), and no subsequent large‑scale scandals of comparable magnitude have emerged at Pfizer.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The story is a useful illustration of how post‑publication scrutiny can affect corporate research integrity and drug‑development decisions, but the scientific content itself did not lead to lasting therapeutic breakthroughs.
