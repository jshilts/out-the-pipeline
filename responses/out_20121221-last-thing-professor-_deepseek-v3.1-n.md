# The Last Thing a Professor Wants to Hear (December 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief 2012 commentary highlights a retraction in PNAS of RNA-driven cell death research from a Caltech laboratory. The article notes that anomalous experimental results discovered by multiple lab members triggered concerns about possible research misconduct. A Caltech faculty investigation committee concluded that the first author had falsified and misrepresented data in the published paper. The commentary observes that the first author did not sign the retraction statement and had apparently relocated to London, leaving behind a significant problem for the Pasadena lab.

## 2. HISTORY
This case involved the retraction of "Programmable in situ amplification for multiplexed imaging of mRNA expression" (KluƩch et al., PNAS, 2010), which described a method called RProbe for RNA detection. The research came from Niles Pierce's lab at Caltech. The retraction occurred after the first author, Amr M. KluƩch, was found to have falsified data. 

The Office of Research Integrity (ORI) completed its investigation in 2015, issuing a finding of research misconduct against KluƩch. The ORI determined he had fabricated and falsified experimental data across multiple figures in the PNAS paper. As a result, KluƩch entered into a voluntary settlement agreement that included a five-year supervision requirement for any federally funded research.

The immediate impact was the retraction of the key publication, but the broader research direction of the Pierce lab appears to have continued successfully. Pierce's laboratory at Caltech continued working on nucleic acid circuit engineering and molecular programming, with subsequent publications in reputable journals. The incident did not appear to substantially derail the lab's research program, though it did represent a significant integrity violation requiring institutional response and ORI oversight.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments.

## 4. INTEREST
**3/9**

This ranks in the 30th-40th percentile of interest. While research misconduct cases are important for scientific integrity, this particular incident had limited broader impact beyond the immediate lab and represented a fairly routine (though serious) case of data fabrication handled through established institutional and federal channels.
