# Marathon Pharmaceuticals Cashes Out (April 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Marathon Pharmaceuticals, which obtained FDA approval to market Emflaza (deflazacort), a long-used steroid treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in the US. The drug had been available internationally for years as a generic, but Marathon leveraged the FDA's orphan drug program to gain market exclusivity and planned to charge approximately $89,000 annually—a dramatic price increase. Following public outcry over this pricing strategy, Marathon abruptly sold the drug to PTC Therapeutics for approximately $140 million in March 2017, just a month after approval. The article notes that Marathon appeared to be winding down operations after turning a quick profit, having likely spent less than $70 million on the drug's approval. Additionally, Marathon received a priority review voucher worth potentially $100 million that could be sold separately. The author criticizes this business model as exploiting regulatory loopholes and calls for FDA reform of incentive structures.

## 2. HISTORY

**Deflazacort market outcomes:** PTC Therapeutics did launch Emflaza in 2017 after acquiring it from Marathon. The drug received FDA approval in February 2017 and became commercially available. PTC initially priced the drug at approximately $35,000 per year—significantly lower than Marathon's proposed $89,000 but still substantially higher than international generic versions.

**Clinical development and label expansion:** In 2019, the FDA approved Emflaza for patients aged 2-5 years, expanding beyond the original indication. Clinical data showed deflazacort had a different side effect profile compared to prednisone, with potentially less weight gain but more cataracts and growth suppression concerns.

**Insurance and reimbursement challenges:** PTC faced significant payer pushback as predicted. Many insurance companies initially resisted covering Emflaza at its premium price given the availability of much cheaper alternatives like prednisone. The drug's uptake was slower than expected due to both pricing concerns and questions about comparative effectiveness.

**PTC's broader DMD franchise:** PTC Therapeutics continued pursuing Duchenne treatments, gaining accelerated approval for Translarna (ataluren) in Europe, though this drug faced its own efficacy questions and was not approved in the US. The company's stock experienced significant volatility related to these regulatory and commercial challenges.

**Priority Review Voucher outcome:** Marathon did indeed sell its rare pediatric disease priority review voucher. In June 2017, Novartis acquired the voucher for $130 million, providing additional profit beyond the $140 million drug sale to PTC.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **PTC's marketing challenges**: ✓ **Accurate**. The article predicted PTC would face difficulties selling deflazacort due to pricing controversy and insurance resistance. This proved correct—PTC encountered significant payer pushback, leading to slower-than-expected uptake and eventual price reduction from the original $89,000 target.

• **Marathon's imminent dissolution**: ✓ **Accurate**. The article predicted Marathon would "disappear" after cashing out. Marathon did wind down operations following the sales, with the company effectively ceasing to exist as an operating entity after completing the transactions.

• **Priority Review Voucher value (~$100 million)**: ✓ **Accurate**. The author estimated the voucher could bring "another $100 million or so." The actual sale price was $130 million, validating this prediction.

• **Insurance payer resistance**: ✓ **Accurate**. The article predicted payers would resist the high price given weak evidence of superiority over cheap alternatives. This materialized as insurance companies questioned the value proposition and initially limited coverage.

• **Marathon's low development costs**: ✓ **Accurate**. The article suggested development costs were minimal ("probably a lot less" than $70 million). This business model—repurposing existing drugs with minimal R&D investment—became a recognized strategy, though not unique to Marathon.

## 4. INTEREST 

Rating: **6/10**

The article captures an important case study in pharmaceutical pricing strategies and regulatory gaming, with reasonably accurate predictions about the specific outcomes. However, the broader systemic issues identified have seen only limited reform, making it more of historical interest than a guide to current industry practices.
