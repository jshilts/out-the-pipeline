# Forecasting Drug Sales: Har, Har. (October 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a Nature Reviews Drug Discovery paper by McKinsey researchers examining the accuracy of pharmaceutical sales forecasts. The study analyzed drug launches from 2002-2011, focusing on three key questions: historical forecast accuracy, types of errors, and whether certain drug categories were easier or harder to predict.

The findings were stark: over 60% of consensus forecasts were wrong by 40% or more, even when made just one year before drug launches. The error distribution showed a peculiar pattern - not a normal Gaussian distribution, but rather a long tail stretching into wildly overoptimistic predictions. CNS and cardiovascular drugs tended to be overestimated, while oncology drugs were typically underestimated (likely due to underestimation of new indication approvals). Accuracy barely improved even five years post-launch, and forecasts for later drugs in a class were no better than for first-in-class compounds.

The author questions whether the extensive time and effort invested in forecasting provides any real value, especially given the massive financial stakes involved in investment decisions and acquisitions.

## 2. HISTORY

The fundamental challenge of pharmaceutical forecasting that this 2013 article highlighted has persisted and even intensified in the subsequent decade. The biopharma industry has continued to grapple with forecast accuracy, though the nature of the challenges has evolved.

Several trends emerged post-2013 that have both complicated and potentially improved forecasting approaches:

**Continued Poor Accuracy**: The systemic over-optimism in drug forecasting remained a persistent issue. High-profile failures like numerous Alzheimer's drug candidates and expensive late-stage clinical trial failures continued to demonstrate how difficult it is to predict which compounds will succeed.

**Rise of Specialty Drugs**: The shift toward orphan drugs, gene therapies, and highly specialized oncology treatments created new forecasting complexities. These drugs often have smaller patient populations, different pricing models, and unique market dynamics that traditional forecasting models struggled to capture.

**Pricing Pressure and Market Access**: Increased scrutiny from payers, the growth of pharmacy benefit managers, and healthcare cost containment measures added new variables to forecasting models that weren't as prominent in the 2002-2011 period studied.

**Data and Analytics Evolution**: Pharmaceutical companies increasingly adopted more sophisticated analytics, real-world evidence, and machine learning approaches to improve forecasting, though these didn't necessarily solve the fundamental challenges identified in the McKinsey study.

**Regulatory Changes**: Faster approval pathways, conditional approvals, and adaptive trial designs changed the drug development timeline and market introduction patterns, affecting forecasting assumptions.

The psychological and organizational biases identified in the original article - particularly the tendency toward over-optimism - appear to have remained entrenched in industry culture, though some companies have become more transparent about forecast uncertainty.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Article's Predictions/Findings:**
- Drug sales forecasts would continue to be highly inaccurate
- People in the industry would claim their own forecasting methods were superior despite systemic evidence
- Consultants would continue marketing improved forecasting capabilities
- Consensus forecasts would remain unreliable even with experienced professionals and sophisticated methodologies

**Outcomes:**
✓ **Prediction validated**: Poor forecast accuracy has remained a persistent industry problem. Numerous studies and industry reports in the 2014-2024 period continued to show significant forecast errors, particularly for novel therapies and unmet medical needs.

✓ **Prediction validated**: The defensive response described in the article - companies claiming their internal forecasts are better and consultants marketing superior methodologies - continued throughout the decade. This reflects deep-seated cognitive biases and organizational incentives.

✓ **Prediction validated**: Consensus forecasts continued to show poor reliability, with major acquisitions and investment decisions still frequently based on overly optimistic projections. The biotech boom and subsequent corrections in the 2010s and early 2020s demonstrated how market sentiment and expert consensus could diverge dramatically from actual outcomes.

**Broader Pattern**: The article's core insight - that pharmaceutical forecasting suffers from systematic over-optimism and poor accuracy - proved prescient. The industry didn't fundamentally solve this problem, though methodologies evolved. The psychological and organizational factors driving forecast errors appear to be deeply embedded in how the pharmaceutical industry operates, particularly given the high stakes and long development timelines involved.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

The article addresses a fundamental and persistent challenge in the pharmaceutical industry with compelling data and insights about human psychology and organizational behavior. However, it primarily confirms existing skepticism about forecasting rather than revealing new technological or scientific developments, which limits its novelty.
