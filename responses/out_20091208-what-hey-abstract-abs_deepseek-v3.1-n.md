# What The Hey? (Abstract Abstracts, Part II)
8 Dec 2009

## 1. SUMMARY

The article criticizes an ACS journal abstract that displays an uninformative, cryptic illustration, noting that while the RSS feed only shows the unclear image, the actual ACS abstract page includes slightly more informative text and the prominent name of Ahmed Zewail (which would attract attention). The author previously complained about colored dots and how chemist K.C. Nicolaou colors aromatic rings, but suggests this example is far more opaque.

## 2. HISTORY

Ahmed Zewail (1946-2016) was a Nobel Prize-winning chemist (1999, for femtochemistry) at Caltech whose work spanned ultrafast spectroscopy and molecular biology. In subsequent years, two-dimensional ultrafast spectroscopy and related imaging techniques advanced significantly, with applications expanding into biophysics and materials science. The specific paper referenced (JA907432p, DOI: 10.1021/ja907432p) appears to be a 2009 communication in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, likely on ultrafast or 2D spectroscopy methods. K.C. Nicolaou continued his synthesis work at Rice University and later at the University of California, San Diego, retiring from full-time positions but remaining active in chemical synthesis and education. Notably, the criticism about scientific abstracts and figures has persisted over the years, with journals and researchers recognizing the importance of clear graphical abstracts for broader comprehension.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No explicit forward-looking predictions were made in the article.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

Brief commentary on abstract clarity, noting a prominent chemist but offering little analysis and lacking broader context.
