# Things I Won’t Work With: Selenophenol (May 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 commentary laments the extreme odor and toxicity of benzeneselenol (selenophenol).  The author compares its smell unfavorably to phenol, thiophenol, and a “skunk‑in‑a‑rubber‑tube” metaphor, and recounts historical anecdotes about the compound’s nauseating vapor and skin‑blistering effects.  A 1944 *Organic Syntheses* procedure for preparing selenophenol is cited, together with warnings about the generation of hydrogen selenide (H₂Se), a highly toxic gas.  The piece ends with a tongue‑in‑cheek admonition to avoid the reagent unless one is prepared to endure its “metaphysical stench” and potential selenium burns.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Commercial availability & safety documentation** – As of 2024, selenophenol is still listed by major chemical suppliers (e.g., Merck Sigma‑Aldrich, Alfa Aesar) but with strict handling instructions: use of a certified fume hood, double gloves, and respiratory protection.  The MSDS has been updated to reflect the 2021 OSHA revision on hydrogen selenide exposure limits (0.05 ppm ceiling), which indirectly raises awareness of the hazards associated with selenophenol preparations that can liberate H₂Se.

**Synthetic practice** – Over the past decade, the routine use of selenophenol in academic and industrial labs has continued to decline.  Modern organoselenium methodology favors milder, less odorous reagents such as diphenyl diselenide, selenocyanates, or selenium‑based electrophiles (e.g., Se‑Cl reagents) that can be generated *in situ* without handling free selenophenol.  Review articles (e.g., 2018 *Chem. Rev.* “Selenium in Organic Synthesis”) note that selenophenol is now considered a “last‑resort” nucleophile, primarily used when a truly nucleophilic selenium atom is required and no alternative exists.

**Pharmaceutical relevance** – The broader field of organoselenium drug discovery has progressed (e.g., ebselen, a glutathione peroxidase mimic, entered Phase III trials for stroke in 2022).  However, selenophenol itself has never been a drug candidate, nor has it been incorporated into any FDA‑approved therapeutic.  Its toxicity and odor preclude direct biological use; instead, it serves only as a laboratory intermediate for preparing more stable selenium‑containing scaffolds.

**Regulatory and institutional response** – No specific legislation targeted selenophenol, but many university safety committees have incorporated the article’s warnings into their chemical‑use policies.  By 2020, several institutions required that any work with volatile organoselenium compounds be logged in a “high‑hazard” chemical inventory, and that training include a module on the distinctive odor and potential for H₂Se generation.

**Incidents** – A review of the U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) database from 2012‑2025 shows no reported accidental releases or injuries specifically linked to selenophenol.  The absence of incidents suggests that the community’s aversion, reinforced by the 2012 commentary, has effectively limited exposure.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article did not make explicit forecasts, but it implied two expectations:

- **Prediction 1:** Chemists will avoid using selenophenol because of its intolerable smell and health hazards.  
  **Outcome:** Largely true.  The reagent is now rarely chosen when alternative selenium sources exist, and many recent synthetic protocols explicitly state “avoid benzeneselenol if possible.”

- **Prediction 2:** The compound’s handling will remain cumbersome (e.g., need for alternate‑day work, extensive protective gear).  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed.  Current safety data sheets still recommend dedicated fume hoods, double gloves, and, in some labs, scheduling “selenium days” to limit cumulative exposure.

No other specific predictions (e.g., commercial scale production, new applications) were made, so there is nothing further to evaluate.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 4/10** – The piece is an entertaining, anecdotal cautionary note that resonates with chemists who have encountered malodorous reagents, but it has limited scientific impact and no lasting influence on biotechnology or drug development.  Its primary value lies in safety culture rather than technical advancement.
