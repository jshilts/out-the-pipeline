# BioCentury on the Coming Drug Pricing Crisis (September 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses BioCentury's 2014 "Back to School" issue, which argued that the pharmaceutical industry's traditional free pricing model was crumbling, with Gilead's $84,000 hepatitis C drug Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) serving as a major catalyst. Although payers recognized Sovaldi as a breakthrough, its broad indication and high price created unsustainable costs for healthcare systems, accelerating what BioCentury called the "last bastion of free pricing is crumbling."

BioCentury warned that if the industry didn't proactively develop new value-based pricing models – such as per-course pricing, risk-sharing arrangements, and payment-over-time structures – regulators and payers would impose cost-plus pricing systems based on development costs rather than clinical benefits. The article characterized this as a "tragedy-of-the-commons" situation where industry-wide restraint was needed but individual companies hesitated to move first. The piece advocated for pricing models that better connected drug costs to measurable patient benefits.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2014 warnings proved prescient. The subsequent decade saw exactly the pricing pressures and policy responses BioCentury predicted, though the outcomes have been more complex than simple industry capitulation.

**Immediate Aftermath (2014-2016):** Gilead's Sovaldi did indeed catalyze intense payer backlash. Major insurers like Express Scripts and Anthem began implementing aggressive utilization management, while state Medicaid programs restricted access. Medicare spending on hepatitis C drugs reached billions annually. In response, Gilead introduced pricing competition through its own combination therapies and faced Congressional investigations into its pricing strategy.

**Value-Based Pricing Experiments (2015-2020):** The prediction about risk-sharing arrangements partially materialized. Novartis implemented outcomes-based contracts for its heart failure drug Entresto with some payers, and Amgen negotiated similar arrangements for Repatha. However, these remained limited due to practical challenges around data collection and outcome measurement. More broadly, payers increasingly demanded clinical evidence and cost-effectiveness data through pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) negotiations.

**Policy and Regulatory Response (2015-2020):** Cost-plus pricing did not become dominant, but other regulatory tools emerged. The Inflation Reduction Act (passed 2022, taking effect 2026) introduced Medicare drug price negotiation, directly challenging free pricing for certain drugs. This represented the kind of political intervention the article warned about.

**Industry Adaptation:** Rather than abandoning premium pricing entirely, the industry developed more sophisticated value demonstration strategies. Immuno-oncology drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo achieved premium pricing despite high costs through strong clinical data. Cell and gene therapies like Luxturna and Zolgensma pushed pricing to new highs, with manufacturers offering installment payment models – a form of the payment-over-time approach BioCentury suggested.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction: Industry needs new pricing models based on value for money**
  - **Outcome: Mixed success.** Pharmaceutical companies have become more sophisticated in value demonstration and health economics modeling, but fundamental pricing mechanisms haven't changed as dramatically as predicted. Risk-sharing and outcomes-based contracts remain niche rather than standard practice due to implementation complexities.

• **Prediction: Cost-plus pricing would be imposed if industry didn't act**
  - **Outcome: Partially accurate.** While not adopted wholesale, government intervention did occur. Medicare price negotiations under the Inflation Reduction Act represent a move toward cost-based considerations alongside clinical benefit. Though not pure cost-plus, it's a significant departure from free pricing.

• **Prediction: Sovaldi's launch would accelerate payer resistance**
  - **Outcome: Accurate.** The Sovaldi pricing controversy did trigger intensified payer pushback, utilization management, and broader public scrutiny of drug pricing that continues today. The drug's pricing strategy became a reference point in policy debates for years.

• **Prediction: The industry faced a "tragedy of the commons" requiring collective restraint**
  - **Outcome: No collective restraint materialized.** Individual companies continued maximizing revenue where possible. However, the prediction captures the fundamental tension that still exists between individual company incentives and industry-wide reputation.

• **Prediction: Industry should embrace per-course treatment pricing**
  - **Outcome: Limited adoption.** Oncology drugs still typically price per dose or cycle, though some gene therapies have moved toward one-time treatment models with payment plans.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article represents an important moment of prescient industry self-reflection that anticipated major shifts in pharmaceutical policy and market dynamics. The Sovaldi case did indeed become a watershed moment for drug pricing debates.
