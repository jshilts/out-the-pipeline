# A Specific Crowdfunding Example (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 article highlights a specific crowdfunding campaign on the platform Microryza (now Experiment.com). Professor Michael Pirrung at UC Riverside was seeking funding to resynthesize a natural-product-derived proteasome inhibitor for testing against renal cell carcinoma by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The campaign aimed to fund one month of an experienced postdoctoral researcher's labor to prepare the compound for NCI's next stage of evaluation. The article positioned this as a potential example of how academic research funding might evolve through crowdfunding platforms.

## 2. HISTORY

Microryza, founded in 2012, rebranded to Experiment.com in 2013 and continued operating as a crowdfunding platform for scientific research. Similar platforms emerged including Consano, Petridish, and later platforms like GoFundMe expanded to include research funding. However, crowdfunding has remained a relatively niche funding mechanism for academic research compared to traditional sources like NIH grants, foundation awards, and industry partnerships.

Consumer crowdfunding (like Kickstarter and Indiegogo) became much more prominent and successful, particularly for consumer products, games, and creative projects. A handful of scientific campaigns did achieve viral success, mainly those with clear public appeal or potential for near-term impact. The Michael Pirrung project at UC Riverside may have been funded and the work completed, but most campaigns on these platforms did not achieve the funding goals needed to carry out research.

For renal cell carcinoma treatments, several notable therapies emerged post-2013 including immune checkpoint inhibitors (Keytruda/pembrolizumab approved 2014, Opdivo/nivolumab approved 2015) and targeted agents such as Lenvima (lenvatinib) approved 2015 and Cabometyx (cabozantinib) approved 2016. Proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib (Velcade) and carfilzomib (Kyprolis) did not become frontline renal cell carcinoma treatments; they are primarily used for multiple myeloma. The natural-product proteasome inhibitor mentioned in Pirrung's campaign likely did not lead to an approved renal cell carcinoma drug.

Crowdfunding for science faced several challenges. Most campaigns failed to reach funding targets, and scientists found it difficult to explain complex research to general audiences or compete for public attention amid more entertainment-oriented crowdfunding. The overhead of creating videos, marketing materials, and engaging donors was substantial. Academic institutions preferred traditional funding mechanisms, and scientists remained reliant on established funding pathways.

In broader funding trends, NIH budgets remained fairly flat in real terms after 2013, with modest increases under the 21st Century Cures Act (2016). Early-career scientists continued to face tough competition for grants, and conversations around alternative funding mechanisms continued but did not result in crowdfunding becoming a major pathway for academic science.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Microryza/crowdfunding as a "real part" of academic research funding** — While Microryza (Experiment.com) continued operating, crowdfunding did not become a major or routine part of academic research funding. Most researchers continued relying on federal grants, foundation support, and industry partnerships. Crowdfunding remained marginal. The prediction was overly optimistic.

• **Crowds funding an experienced postdoc's labor for a month to resynthesize a compound for NCI testing** — If the campaign succeeded, the resynthesis may have occurred. However, post-2013, no new proteasome inhibitor for renal cell carcinoma achieved FDA approval or widespread clinical use in that indication. Proteasome inhibitors remained primarily useful for multiple myeloma and other blood cancers, not solid tumors like kidney cancer. The implied therapeutic approach oversold the likelihood of clinical success.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

The article captures a 2013 moment when crowdfunding for science seemed promising, but the example was niche and the broader prediction did not materialize. The specific project likely had minimal long-term scientific or clinical impact, and crowdfunding did not meaningfully reshape academic funding systems. The topic is of modest historical interest but limited broader importance.
