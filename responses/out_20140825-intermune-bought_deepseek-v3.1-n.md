# InterMune Bought (August 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes Roche's acquisition of InterMune for $8.3 billion in August 2014. The piece characterizes InterMune's journey as "bizarre," referencing the company's turbulent history including previous controversies around press releases and volatile investor experiences. The acquisition represents a dramatic turnaround for the company, with the $8.3 billion price tag being an amount that would have seemed unbelievable just a few years earlier. The author notes that Roche's purchase strengthens their position in respiratory therapeutics and predicts this deal will serve as justification for investors to continue betting on small biopharma companies in hopes of finding "the next InterMune."

## 2. HISTORY

Following the acquisition, Roche successfully integrated InterMune and its lead drug pirfenidone (brand name Esbriet) into their portfolio. Esbriet, for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), was already approved in Europe and Canada when the deal closed, and received FDA approval in October 2014, just two months after the acquisition.

The drug went on to become a significant product for Roche, generating substantial revenue in the IPF market alongside Boehringer Ingelheim's Ofev (nintedanib). Both drugs have become standard treatments for IPF, demonstrating real clinical benefit in slowing disease progression. However, the IPF treatment landscape remained challenging as both drugs slow but do not reverse or cure the disease.

The acquisition strategy proved sound for Roche, establishing them as a key player in respiratory medicine. The high valuation set expectations for orphan disease drugs and their potential market, influencing biotech investment patterns and company valuations in subsequent years.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made one key prediction:

• **That the $8.3 billion acquisition would "provide investors a rationale for years as they buy into small biopharma companies"** - This prediction proved largely accurate. The massive premium paid for InterMune, particularly given the company's controversial history and the substantial risks that had existed around pirfenidone's development, did encourage continued high-risk investment in biotech companies targeting rare/orphan diseases. The 2014-2015 period saw heightened M&A activity in the biotech space, with investors pointing to the InterMune deal as validation for premium valuations on companies with promising late-stage assets, even those with complex development histories.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article captures an important moment in the orphan drug space and a landmark biotech acquisition, but it provides limited technical or clinical depth, focusing primarily on the business transaction aspects of the deal.
