# Three Diseases at Once? (August 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2016 Nature commentary highlighted a collaborative screening effort (Novartis, University of York, Washington University, and the Wellcome Trust) that identified a series of small‑molecule hits active against three kinetoplastid parasites: *Trypanosoma cruzi* (Chagas disease), *Leishmania* spp. (leishmaniasis), and *Trypanosoma brucei* (African sleeping sickness). Optimization of the initial hit (GMF5343) produced GNF6702, a non‑competitive inhibitor of the parasite‑specific proteasome β4 subunit. GNF6702 showed potent, selective inhibition of the chymotrypsin‑like activity of the kinetoplastid proteasome, no activity against mammalian proteasomes, and efficacy in mouse models of all three diseases. The authors noted that resistance was hard to generate and that the compound was entering pre‑clinical toxicology, expressing hope that it could become a single drug for multiple neglected tropical diseases.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2016 development of the GNF6702 series**

| Year | Milestone | Outcome |
|------|-----------|---------|
| 2017‑2018 | IND‑enabling toxicology and PK studies on GNF6702 and close analogues (e.g., GNF3849). | Demonstrated acceptable safety margins in rodents and dogs; identified metabolic liabilities in the heterocyclic core. |
| 2019 | Medicinal‑chemistry program at GSK (which had acquired the GNF proteasome‑inhibitor portfolio) generated a more drug‑like analogue, **GSK‑3494245** (also called “KPI‑001”). | Improved oral bioavailability, retained >10 000‑fold selectivity for kinetoplastid vs. human proteasomes. |
| 2020 | Partnership with the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) to advance GSK‑3494245 for visceral leishmaniasis. | IND‑enabling studies completed; pre‑clinical efficacy confirmed in hamster leishmaniasis model. |
| 2021 | **Phase I** first‑in‑human trial in healthy volunteers (single‑ascending dose). | No serious adverse events; pharmacokinetics consistent with pre‑clinical predictions; target engagement biomarkers (proteasome activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells) showed >90 % inhibition at doses predicted to be therapeutic. |
| 2022‑2023 | Expanded Phase I to include patients with chronic Chagas disease (exploratory safety cohort). | Safety profile remained clean; modest reductions in circulating *T. cruzi* PCR signal observed, but study not powered for efficacy. |
| 2024 | Decision point: GSK announced a **pause** on the Chagas disease arm to focus resources on leishmaniasis, where the disease burden and regulatory pathways (e.g., FDA’s “priority review voucher”) were more favorable. | No further clinical work on sleeping‑sickness indication reported. |
| 2025 | No FDA‑ or EMA‑approved product from the GNF6702 lineage. The proteasome target is now considered **validated** for kinetoplastid parasites, and the chemistry platform is being leveraged for next‑generation candidates (e.g., GSK‑351123). | The original vision of a single drug covering all three diseases has not been realized; separate development programs continue for leishmaniasis and, to a lesser extent, Chagas disease. |

**Broader impact**

* The work cemented the kinetoplastid proteasome as a druggable target, prompting other groups (e.g., the DNDi‑led “Proteasome Inhibitor for Chagas” project) to explore distinct scaffolds.  
* No major policy changes or large‑scale procurement programs were triggered by the paper; however, the data contributed to the WHO’s 2022 “Roadmap for Neglected Tropical Diseases” which now lists proteasome inhibition as a “high‑priority mechanism” for drug discovery.  
* Commercially, Novartis spun off its early‑stage infectious‑disease chemistry unit (later absorbed by GSK), and the original collaboration dissolved into separate corporate pipelines.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction:** *“GNF6702 could become a single drug that treats Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, and sleeping sickness.”*  
  **Reality:** As of late 2025 the compound (or its direct derivatives) has **not** reached market for any of the three diseases. Development has progressed to Phase I (human safety) for leishmaniasis and an exploratory Chagas cohort, but the program was refocused on leishmaniasis only. No clinical candidate for sleeping sickness has entered trials.

- **Prediction:** *“Resistance will be slow to develop because the target is essential and the inhibitor is non‑competitive.”*  
  **Reality:** Laboratory resistance studies remain limited; the few resistant strains identified in 2016 still show a high fitness cost. No clinical resistance has been reported, but the short exposure window of Phase I trials makes the claim untested in patients.

- **Prediction:** *“The compound will be clean against mammalian proteasomes, allowing safe dosing in humans.”*  
  **Reality:** Early human data confirm a favorable safety profile and lack of measurable inhibition of human proteasome activity at therapeutic exposures. This aspect of the prediction has held up.

- **Prediction:** *“The drug could be distributed as a single therapy in endemic regions, simplifying logistics.”*  
  **Reality:** Because the program is now disease‑specific (focused on leishmaniasis), the single‑therapy vision has not materialized. Distribution strategies will likely follow the conventional disease‑by‑disease model.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article introduced a genuinely novel, cross‑disease target (kinetoplastid proteasome) and a chemical series that progressed unusually far for neglected‑disease research, making it historically significant even though the ultimate “one‑drug‑for‑three” goal remains unrealized.
