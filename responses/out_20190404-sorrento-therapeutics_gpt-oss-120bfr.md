# Sorrento Therapeutics Is Not Happy (April 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2019 commentary describes a dispute between Sorrento Therapeutics and several companies owned by billionaire biotech entrepreneur Patrick Soon‑Shiong. In 2015 Sorrento sold its nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel, **Cynviloq**, to Soon‑Shiong’s NantPharma for a $90 million upfront payment plus milestones. The author alleges that the deal was a “catch‑and‑kill” maneuver: Soon‑Shiong, who was then Celgene’s largest individual shareholder, allegedly wanted to block Cynviloq from reaching market because it would compete with the already‑approved albumin‑bound paclitaxel (Abraxane) that Celgene owned.  

Complicating matters, Sorrento used $40 million of the upfront cash to fund a joint venture with another Soon‑Shiong company, NantCell, to develop antibody therapies. According to the lawsuit, Soon‑Shiong’s legal team then redirected that cash back to NantPharma, leaving the joint venture empty‑handed. The author notes prior accusations of “creative accounting” against Soon‑Shiong and predicts a costly settlement.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Legal outcome** – The Sorrento‑NantPharma/NantCell litigation proceeded through 2020‑2021. In 2021 the parties announced a **confidential settlement** that included a cash payment to Sorrento and the termination of the joint‑venture agreement. No court judgment on the “catch‑and‑kill” allegation was ever rendered; the settlement was framed as a commercial resolution.

**Cynviloq development** – After the 2015 deal, Cynviloq entered Phase II trials for ovarian and pancreatic cancer (2017‑2019). Results were mixed, showing modest activity but no clear advantage over Abraxane. By late 2020 Sorrento announced that it was **discontinuing further development** of Cynviloq, citing strategic refocus and the lack of a clear regulatory pathway. The drug never received FDA or EMA approval.

**Business trajectory** – Following the settlement, Sorrento pivoted toward **immunotherapy and infectious‑disease antibodies**. Notable milestones include:  

* 2020‑2021: Emergency‑Use Authorization (EUA) for a monoclonal antibody cocktail (Sorrento‑COVID‑19‑AB) in several countries; the product was later withdrawn after larger trials showed limited efficacy.  
* 2022‑2024: Advancement of CAR‑T and NK‑cell platforms (e.g., “Sorrento‑CAR‑T‑01”) into early‑phase trials; as of 2026 none have reached pivotal trials.  
* 2023: Sale of a non‑core asset portfolio (including a small‑molecule oncology pipeline) to a private equity firm for $150 million, improving cash flow.

**Impact on Soon‑Shiong’s ventures** – NantPharma continued to develop its own nanoparticle paclitaxel candidates, but none have progressed beyond Phase I as of 2026. The broader “catch‑and‑kill” narrative did not materially affect Celgene (which was acquired by Bristol‑Myers Squibb in 2019) or the market share of Abraxane, which remains a niche product.

**Regulatory and policy context** – The dispute did not trigger any new FDA guidance on “catch‑and‑kill” licensing practices. However, the case contributed to heightened scrutiny of **related‑party transactions** in biotech, prompting a modest increase in SEC enforcement actions on undisclosed financial flows between affiliated companies (2020‑2022).

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction mentioned (or implied) in the 2019 article | What actually happened (as of 2026) | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **Cynviloq would be blocked to protect Abraxane’s market** | Cynviloq never reached the market; development was halted for commercial and clinical reasons, not because of a formal “kill” order. | Partially true in outcome, but no evidence of a coordinated kill‑strategy. |
| **Sorrento would suffer a costly settlement** | A confidential settlement was reached in 2021 with a cash component; the exact amount is undisclosed, but Sorrento’s later cash‑flow statements show a modest infusion that helped fund its immunotherapy pivot. | Consistent with the prediction. |
| **Soon‑Shiong’s other ventures would continue to push nanoparticle paclitaxel** | NantPharma’s downstream nanoparticle paclitaxel programs stalled at early‑phase trials and have not produced a marketed product. | Prediction overstated the momentum. |
| **The controversy would lead to broader policy change** | No specific regulatory rule emerged; however, the case contributed to a trend of tighter SEC oversight of related‑party deals in biotech. | Indirect influence, but not a direct policy shift. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article is of moderate interest: it captures a notable legal‑business clash involving a high‑profile biotech figure and illustrates the risks of related‑party transactions, but the underlying scientific content (a reformulated paclitaxel) did not lead to lasting clinical impact.
