# Mannkind's Last Stand (January 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article argues that Mannkind, with its inhaled insulin product Afrezza, "looks doomed" following Sanofi's termination of their partnership agreement. Afrezza was not selling, echoing the commercial failure of Pfizer's earlier inhaled insulin Exubera—the core problem being an insufficient market for inhaled insulin despite years of development and investment. Mannkind was described as very close to bankruptcy, facing "just about insurmountable" financial challenges, including the need to fund a large post-launch safety trial on its own. The author dismissed bullish retail investor narratives (calling Afrezza supporters "$MNKD cultists") as delusional and predicted the company would fail.

## 2. HISTORY

After the January 2016 article, Mannkind did not collapse. Instead, it restructured and continued to commercialize Afrezza:
- **Post-Sanofi commercialization**: Mannkind took back full control and re-launched Afrezza, pursuing a direct-to-patient and targeted physician strategy. Sales grew modestly from a very low base.
- **Financial restructuring**: The company raised capital through stock offerings and debt, diluting shareholders but averting bankruptcy.
- **FDA regulatory outcomes**: 
  - In 2014, Afrezza was approved by the FDA for adult patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
  - A **post-marketing requirement (PMRC)** was imposed for a pediatric study and long-term safety study, confirmed in FDA documents.
- **Clinical utility and adoption**: Afrezza has remained a niche product. Despite its ultra-rapid onset, uptake has been constrained by device usability, cost/reimbursement, lung-function monitoring requirements, and market preference for injections/pumps. It has not become a standard of care.
- **Mannkind's business evolution**: The company expanded beyond Afrezza into contract development and manufacturing (CDMO) services and other pipeline assets to diversify revenue.
- **Afrezza's market presence today**: It is still marketed in the U.S. and available by prescription for a select patient population. However, it has not achieved wide adoption or blockbuster sales to alter diabetes management broadly.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article's predictions and their outcomes:
- **Prediction: Mannkind would fail and Afrezza would not achieve commercial viability.**
  - *Outcome*: Partially correct on commercial scale—Mannkind avoided bankruptcy and Afrezza remained on the market, but it never achieved significant market penetration or disrupted standard diabetes care; it remains a niche therapy.
- **Prediction: Sanofi's exit would be fatal to Mannkind.**
  - *Outcome*: Incorrect—Mannkind survived by restructuring and self-commercializing, though at considerable shareholder dilution and continued financial pressure.
- **Implied prediction: Inhaled insulin would replicate the Exubera failure.**
  - *Outcome*: Largely correct regarding mainstream adoption—Afrezza did not meaningfully expand the inhaled-insulin market and did not redefine diabetes treatment; most patients and physicians continued using injectables, pumps, and other non-inhaled therapies.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article is historically interesting as a snapshot of skepticism during a critical moment for an innovative but commercially troubled therapy. While the author correctly assessed that inhaled insulin would remain niche, the company ultimately survived—making it a cautionary case in biotech financing and persistence, but of moderate importance to the broader field.
