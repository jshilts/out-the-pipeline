# The Flu Plan, Part One: Vaccines (November 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2005 commentary analyzes the U.S. government's proposed pandemic flu plan, focusing on vaccine production and policy. The article centers on the need to move from traditional chicken-egg vaccine manufacturing to cell culture techniques, which the author supports as a "fine idea" that should have been implemented years earlier. The piece highlights frustrations in the biotech industry, particularly Protein Sciences' complaint that Health and Human Services (HHS) awarded a $97 million contract to an unproven cell-based vaccine while ignoring companies with products closer to approval. The author also discusses liability protection for vaccine manufacturers as a provision that will likely spark controversy, and emphasizes a crucial limitation: even with improved technology, vaccine development involves months of unavoidable delays, creating a window during which viruses can mutate and evade protection.

## 2. HISTORY

Cell-culture flu vaccines ultimately succeeded but not in time for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The FDA approved the first cell-based influenza vaccine in November 2012—seven years after this article—manufactured by Novartis (now part of Seqirus). The technology did eventually replace many egg-based systems and offers faster production timelines, with companies like CSL Seqirus, Sanofi, and others adopting cell-culture platforms. These vaccines were in widespread use by the 2019-2020 flu season and continued through subsequent years.

Protein Sciences, the company quoted in frustration, was ultimately acquired by Sanofi in 2017 for $650 million after successfully developing their recombinant protein vaccine Flublok, which received FDA approval in January 2013 using insect cell culture rather than eggs. Their frustration about HHS missing more advanced candidates proved prescient, as their technology did demonstrate advantages.

The liability protection issue evolved through federal law. The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act was enacted in 2005 (shortly after this article) and provides liability protection for countermeasures including vaccines, addressing exactly the concern raised here. This became particularly relevant during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and again during COVID-19.

Regarding timing concerns, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic starkly confirmed the article's warnings: the pandemic peaked in October-November 2009, but vaccine availability only ramped up that November/December, when many infections had already occurred. The author's caution about delays proved accurate.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

•**Cell-culture vaccines as the future**: The article was correct that cell-culture manufacturing would become important. Success came later than hoped—first approval in 2012 rather than immediate implementation—but the technology did eventually replace substantial egg-based production capacity. The government's slow funding decisions did likely delay timelines.

•**Liability protection causing controversy**: This prediction proved accurate. The PREP Act became important for vaccine manufacturers, and debates around liability protection reemerged during both the 2009 H1N1 response and COVID-19, though the legal framework was established earlier than the "interesting fight" the author anticipated might occur out of sight.

•**Vaccine development delays leaving populations vulnerable**: This was the most accurate prediction, tragically validated in 2009 when the H1N1 pandemic peaked before adequate vaccine supplies were available. Production delays of 4-6 months remained a persistent challenge for influenza vaccines, though cell-culture systems did eventually improve speed compared to egg-based methods.

•**Risk of viral mutation outpacing vaccines**: This concern remained valid. Seasonal influenza vaccines show variable effectiveness (40-60% in good years), partly due to mismatch between circulating strains and vaccine strains selected months earlier. The fundamental biological challenge of viral evolution outpacing vaccine development persisted.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

The article demonstrated sharp insight into several critical issues that played out over the subsequent decade: the timing and politics of vaccine technology transitions, the importance of liability frameworks, and the fundamental limitations of vaccine-based pandemic response. Its predictions proved remarkably accurate.
