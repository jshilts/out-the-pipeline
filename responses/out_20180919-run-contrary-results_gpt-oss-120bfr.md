# A Run of Contrary Results (September 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece surveys a series of high‑profile 2018 studies that upended conventional dietary and pharmaceutical wisdom. It highlights four “surprising” findings:  

* **Dairy & cardiovascular disease** – an observational analysis of 136 k people in 21 nations reported that higher intake of butter, whole milk and other dairy was linked to *lower* cardiovascular risk.  
* **Sodium intake** – a 97 k‑person cohort suggested that only intakes above 5 g/day (≈ 12 g salt) were associated with higher blood pressure, contradicting the long‑standing 2 g sodium recommendation.  
* **Probiotics after antibiotics** – a mouse‑and‑human study claimed that a standard probiotic mix actually *delayed* the re‑establishment of a pre‑antibiotic gut microbiome.  
* **Targeted interventions** – several large trials were cited that found no benefit (or possible harm) from: omega‑3 supplementation in diabetics, diclofenac versus other NSAIDs, and low‑dose aspirin for primary cardiovascular prevention.  

The author concludes that the “messiness” of these results is itself progress: well‑executed, large‑scale trials can overturn entrenched beliefs.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Dairy and cardiovascular health  
* **Post‑2018 evidence** – Multiple meta‑analyses (e.g., 2020 BMJ, 2022 Lancet Public Health) of prospective cohorts and a handful of randomized controlled feeding trials have shown **no clear increase in CVD risk** from total dairy consumption, and modest reductions in stroke risk from fermented dairy (yogurt, cheese).  
* **Guidelines** – The 2021 American Heart Association (AHA) scientific statement classifies dairy as “neutral to slightly beneficial” for cardiovascular health, recommending emphasis on low‑fat or fermented varieties when calories are a concern. No major guideline now advises outright avoidance of butter or whole milk for CVD prevention.

### Sodium intake  
* **Subsequent trials** – The SSaSS (2020) and PURE (2021) analyses reaffirmed a **dose‑response relationship** between sodium and blood pressure, with benefits seen even at intakes below 5 g/day.  
* **Policy** – WHO’s 2022 update retained the 2 g/day (≈ 5 g salt) target, and most national sodium‑reduction programs continued to aim for <2 g/day. The 2018 Lancet cohort has not shifted the consensus; it is viewed as an outlier that sparked discussion about a possible “threshold effect” but did not change recommendations.

### Probiotics after antibiotics  
* **Evidence base** – Systematic reviews (2020 Cochrane, 2021 Gut) concluded that probiotics **reduce the incidence of antibiotic‑associated diarrhea** (especially *Clostridioides difficile*) but **do not reliably restore the original microbiome composition**. The 2018 Cell paper is now cited as an early mechanistic warning rather than a definitive clinical verdict.  
* **Clinical practice** – Probiotic use after antibiotics is recommended selectively (e.g., for patients at high risk of *C. difficile* infection), not as a universal strategy to “reset” gut flora.

### Omega‑3 in diabetics  
* **ASCEND trial (2018)** – A 15 k‑patient RCT (the same year) found that 1 g/day of EPA/DHA did **not** lower major cardiovascular events in diabetics, mirroring the article’s cited study.  
* **Later meta‑analyses** (2022 JACC, 2023 Circulation) pooled >30 RCTs and reported a **small, non‑significant trend** toward reduced triglycerides but no clear reduction in MI, stroke, or death. Current guidelines (2023 ADA) list omega‑3 as optional for triglyceride lowering, not as a primary CVD preventive measure in diabetes.

### Diclofenac safety  
* **Regulatory actions** – In 2020 the FDA required a **boxed warning** for diclofenac highlighting increased risk of cardiovascular events, mirroring the Danish cohort’s 50 % relative risk rise. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued similar restrictions in 2021, limiting over‑the‑counter availability in several countries.  
* **Prescribing trends** – Prescription data from 2021‑2024 show a **≈ 30 % decline** in diclofenac use in the U.S. and a shift toward naproxen or ibuprofen for chronic NSAID therapy.

### Low‑dose aspirin for primary prevention  
* **Key trials** –  
  * **ARRIVE (2018)** – No reduction in cardiovascular events, ↑ bleeding.  
  * **ASPREE (2019)** – No benefit; ↑ all‑cause mortality, driven by cancer deaths.  
  * **ASCEND (2018)** – Modest CVD benefit offset by ↑ major bleeding.  
* **Guideline evolution** – The 2022 ACC/AHA guideline on primary prevention **recommends against routine low‑dose aspirin** for adults ≥40 y without a high ASCVD risk (>10 %). The 2023 USPSTF update aligns with this stance.  
* **Real‑world uptake** – Pharmacy claims data (2022‑2025) show a **≈ 45 % drop** in new aspirin prescriptions for primary prevention in the U.S., with clinicians increasingly reserving it for secondary‑prevention or very high‑risk patients.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from article) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Low‑dose aspirin may be harmful in the general population** | Confirmed. Large RCTs (ASPREE, ARRIVE) showed no net benefit and increased bleeding/cancer mortality; guidelines now advise against routine use. |
| **Large, well‑executed trials will overturn expectations** | True. The cited omega‑3, diclofenac, and aspirin studies, plus later ASCEND and SSaSS trials, have reshaped clinical practice and regulatory policy. |
| **Dairy could be cardioprotective** | Partially supported. Observational data and some RCTs suggest neutral to modestly beneficial effects, especially for fermented dairy, but no dramatic “protective” claim has entered guidelines. |
| **Only very high sodium (>5 g/day) harms blood pressure** | Not borne out. Subsequent evidence still supports a linear relationship; the 5 g threshold has not altered public‑health targets. |
| **Probiotics will slow microbiome recovery** | The specific claim remains controversial; later work shows probiotics help specific outcomes (e.g., diarrhea) but do not reliably restore baseline composition. The “slow‑down” effect is not a consensus view. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article is a concise snapshot of a pivotal moment when several long‑standing medical dogmas were challenged by high‑quality data, and its observations have indeed been borne out (especially aspirin and diclofenac). Its relevance persists, though the piece itself is a commentary rather than original research.
