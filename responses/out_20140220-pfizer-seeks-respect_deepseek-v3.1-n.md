# Pfizer Seeks Respect (February 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a LinkedIn post by Pfizer CEO Ian Read from February 2014, in which Read acknowledges the pharmaceutical industry's reputation problem and the critical importance of earning public respect. Read describes how "earning greater respect from society" became one of Pfizer's four business imperatives after he became CEO in 2010, recognizing that reputation is essential for the company's "virtual license to operate." Key points include: the intense scrutiny pharmaceutical companies face from regulators, legislators, and the public; the emotional nature of public discourse around drug pricing, product effectiveness, and marketing practices; and Read's admission that "we gain respect in drops, but lose it in gallons." The original commentary notes that while Read acknowledges the problem, he provides little detail about specific actions Pfizer would take or what specific incidents led to this respect deficit, offering mostly generic corporate language about "connecting better with stakeholders."

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following Read's 2014 statement, Pfizer's reputation faced significant challenges, though the company also achieved major successes:

**Drug Pricing Controversies (2014-2020s)**: Pfizer faced intense public criticism and political scrutiny over drug pricing. Most notably, the company came under fire in 2016 for dramatic price increases on older drugs, particularly the EpiPen alternative Auvi-Q (though not a Pfizer product, the controversy highlighted industry-wide pricing issues). In 2018, Pfizer announced it would delay planned price increases following public pressure from the Trump administration.

**Drug Development Successes**: Pfizer achieved major clinical successes that did restore some respect. Most significantly, the company's COVID-19 vaccine (developed with BioNTech) was one of the first authorized vaccines in December 2020 and became one of the most widely administered vaccines globally. This represented perhaps Pfizer's most significant public health contribution in decades and temporarily improved public perception.

**Business Developments**: In 2015, Pfizer acquired Hospira for $17 billion, expanding its generics business. The company attempted a massive $160 billion merger with Allergan in 2015-2016 (inversion deal), which collapsed due to new Treasury regulations, creating negative publicity around tax avoidance strategies. In 2019, Pfizer merged its off-patent drug business with Mylan to form Viatris, streamlining operations.

**Clinical Failures**: Several high-profile late-stage failures occurred, including the discontinuation of bococizumab (PCSK9 inhibitor) in 2016 due to safety concerns and immunogenicity issues, and the 2018 failure of a Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug.

**Regulatory Issues**: Pfizer continued facing regulatory challenges, including FDA warnings over marketing practices and manufacturing quality issues at various facilities.

The fundamental reputation problem Read identified in 2014 persisted throughout his tenure and beyond, with drug pricing remaining a central political and public concern impacting all major pharmaceutical companies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Read's implied prediction**: That focusing on reputation would become central to business strategy and stakeholder relations. **Outcome**: While Pfizer did continue to emphasize reputation management, the core issues (especially drug pricing) remained largely unaddressed, and public trust in pharma generally continued to decline through 2015-2019, with only temporary improvement during the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.
  
- **Inferred prediction about gaining respect "in drops"**: The idea that systematic reputation improvement would be gradual. **Outcome**: Partially accurate—Pfizer did see reputation gains from its COVID-19 vaccine success, but these were largely event-driven rather than sustained improvements from systematic changes. The fundamental structural issues around pricing and transparency that drive public distrust remained largely unchanged.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

While the article touches on a real and persistent issue, it was primarily a commentary on a corporate reputation management piece that offered few concrete insights or predictions. The topic of pharma reputation is important but this particular article didn't provide substantial analysis or make specific, testable predictions about pharmaceutical industry developments.
