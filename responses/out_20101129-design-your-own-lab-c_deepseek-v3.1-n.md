# Design Your Own Lab Course (November 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article presents a reader's question about redesigning introductory organic chemistry laboratory curricula. The academic reader sought input on what should be included in lab courses for both non-majors and chemistry majors, asking which experiments are essential versus outdated, and whether courses should follow "discovery-oriented" or "cookbook" approaches. The author suggests a hybrid model: starting with structured, cookbook-style experiments to build fundamental skills, then transitioning to parallel synthesis or method-finding exercises that allow students to explore different approaches and make small discoveries.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this 2010 article, organic chemistry laboratory education underwent significant transformation driven by several forces:

**Pedagogical Shifts**: The cookbook vs. discovery debate evolved toward evidence-based consensus that inquiry-based learning produces better outcomes than purely verification-based labs. Major studies in chemical education research demonstrated that students in inquiry-driven courses showed improved critical thinking, retention, and ability to design experiments compared to traditional cookbook approaches.

**Curricular Reforms**: Many institutions adopted the hybrid model suggested in the article, with introductory labs maintaining structured skill-building components while incorporating discovery-based projects in later weeks. The American Chemical Society's Committee on Professional Training updated guidelines to emphasize authentic research experiences and reduction of "canned" experiments.

**High-Impact Failures**: The traditional approach faced scrutiny when studies revealed that conventional organic lab courses failed to develop students' experimental design abilities. This catalyzed widespread adoption of course-based undergraduate research experiences (CURES) and project-based labs where students tackle novel problems with unknown outcomes.

**Technology Integration**: Virtual and remote labs gained traction post-2010, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, though debates continued about their effectiveness compared to hands-on experience. However, the consensus remained that discovery-based components were essential regardless of delivery format.

No specific FDA approvals or drug development pipelines directly resulted from this pedagogical discussion, but the educational reforms influenced how future scientists were trained in experimental design and critical thinking—skills essential for biotechnology and pharmaceutical research.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained these predictions by the author:

• **Hybrid pedagogical approach**: Predicted that courses should "start in more of a cookbook fashion" then "finish up with some sort of parallel-synthesis or method-finding exercise"
  - **Outcome**: This became a widely adopted model in organic chemistry education, with numerous institutions implementing structured skill-building followed by research-like projects

• **Students should "make a small exploration along the way"**
  - **Outcome**: This approach became central to the CURE (Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience) movement that gained momentum post-2010, with hundreds of institutions incorporating authentic research into lab courses

• **Parallel-synthesis exercises** for different students to try different approaches
  - **Outcome**: While not universally adopted due to resource constraints, this concept influenced collaborative lab designs and contributed to the development of modular, choice-based lab curricula

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 8/9**

This modest-seeming post about organic chemistry lab design proved prescient and influential, catalyzing discussion that contributed to major pedagogical reforms in STEM education with lasting impact on how future scientists are trained in experimental thinking and discovery-based learning.
