# Rotten Rottlerin (April 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article criticizes the continued use of rottlerin as a selective PKC-delta inhibitor in biological research, despite evidence that it lacks selectivity and may not actually inhibit PKC-delta at all. The compound, isolated from an Indian plant in the 1800s, was identified as a PKC-delta inhibitor in the early 1990s and has been used in countless studies. However, research has shown it to be non-selective with multiple off-target activities, and the original PKC activity may have been due to impurities. The author questions why researchers continue using rottlerin as a PKC-delta control as late as 2015, citing multiple recent papers that still treat it as a selective inhibitor. The piece also criticizes commercial suppliers like EMD/Millipore/Calbiochem for marketing it as a selective PKC-delta inhibitor, while acknowledging that Tocris provides more transparent information about the compound's actual effects.

## 2. HISTORY
The use of rottlerin in scientific literature continued well beyond 2015, though with increasing recognition of its problematic nature. By the late 2010s, many researchers and institutions began explicitly warning against using rottlerin as a selective PKC-delta inhibitor. Major suppliers gradually updated their product descriptions to reflect the compound's lack of selectivity, though some commercial sources continued marketing it as a selective inhibitor into the late 2010s. The scientific community's awareness of problematic tool compounds grew significantly, leading to initiatives for better compound validation and more rigorous reporting standards. However, problematic papers citing rottlerin as a selective PKC-delta inhibitor continued appearing in lower-tier journals. This issue became part of a broader discussion about research quality and reproducibility in biomedical sciences, though specific regulatory or policy changes directly addressing rottlerin use did not emerge.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Implicit prediction that rottlerin use would decline**: The author strongly implied that continued use of rottlerin as a selective PKC-delta inhibitor was indefensible and should stop. **Outcome**: Use did decline in high-quality research, but persisted in some contexts, demonstrating the challenge of changing established practices even when evidence is clear.

• **Prediction about supplier practices**: The author criticized suppliers for misleading product descriptions. **Outcome**: Some suppliers improved transparency, but others continued problematic marketing, showing that commercial incentives can outweigh scientific accuracy.

• **Implicit prediction about scientific self-correction**: The article suggested that the community should recognize and abandon problematic compounds. **Outcome**: Scientific self-correction occurred but was slower and less complete than ideal, highlighting systemic issues in research quality control.

• **Prediction about reliability of published literature**: The article noted that much published literature contains unreliable information about tool compounds like rottlerin. **Outcome**: This concern proved prescient regarding reproducibility issues, leading to greater scrutiny of biological reagents and methods in subsequent years.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

This article addresses important issues of research quality and compound validation that remain relevant in biomedical sciences. However, it focuses on a relatively specific technical problem rather than broader scientific or policy developments.
