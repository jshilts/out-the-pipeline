# A Movement Towards Tau in Alzheimer's? (May 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This May 2017 commentary by Derek Lowe captures a pivotal moment in Alzheimer's drug development. The article describes how the amyloid hypothesis—targeting amyloid-beta protein—had resulted in "failure after failure" in clinical trials, creating disillusionment in the field. Against this backdrop, pharmaceutical companies were shifting attention to tau protein, another pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. The piece documents a wave of tau-focused programs: Merck licensing Teijin's tau antibody, AC Immune partnering with J&J on tau antibodies, AbbVie advancing an anti-tau antibody to Phase II, and Biogen licensing Bristol-Myers Squibb's anti-tau program. The author notes this represents industry sentiment that "another crack at amyloid is not the way to go" given the "relentless string of brutally expensive failures," while acknowledging that tau results would take years to materialize due to slow Alzheimer's trial timelines. The article concludes with a cautionary note suggesting previous amyloid trials may have advanced based on wishful thinking rather than solid Phase II data, creating moral hazards in drug development.

## 2. HISTORY

**Tau Programs After 2017:**

The tau-focused programs mentioned in the article faced their own significant challenges in the years following publication:

- **TauRx (mentioned for past failures)**: Continued development with later trials still showing mixed or disappointing results, failing to achieve primary endpoints in subsequent Phase III studies.

- **Merck/Teijin antibody**: This collaboration and other tau antibody programs generally failed to demonstrate clear clinical efficacy in Alzheimer's disease, despite some showing target engagement in the brain.

- **AbbVie's ABBV-8E12 (tilavonemab)**: Progressed to Phase II trials for both Alzheimer's and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Results published in subsequent years showed the drug failed to meet primary efficacy endpoints, failing to slow disease progression despite being well-tolerated.

- **Biogen's tau program**: After licensing BMS's anti-tau antibody, Biogen continued development but eventually discontinued or deprioritized tau antibody programs as clinical data failed to show benefit.

**Broader Tau Research Trends (2017-2024):**

While antibody approaches struggled, tau biology research continued revealing the protein's complex role in neurodegenerative diseases. However, therapeutic translation remained challenging. Most tau-targeting drugs that advanced to late-stage trials failed to show clinical benefit, despite some demonstrating biomarker effects suggesting target engagement.

**The Amyloid Story Continued:** Interestingly, the article's pessimistic assessment of amyloid therapy preceded significant developments. Biogen's aducanumab (approved 2021) and lecanemab (approved 2023) ultimately gained FDA approval for Alzheimer's, though amid considerable controversy about clinical meaningfulness of their modest benefits. The amyloid hypothesis thus saw partial validation after the article's publication, even as tau approaches continued to struggle.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit and explicit predictions that can be evaluated against subsequent developments:

**• Prediction:** *"It's unfortunately going to be quite a while before we see what any of the [tau] agents do"* — **ACCURATE**. Most tau programs took 4-7 years to report Phase II/III results, with the majority showing negative outcomes.

**• Prediction:** *Several companies decided "another crack at amyloid is not the way to go"* — **PARTIALLY INACCURATE**. While companies did pivot toward tau, the field didn't abandon amyloid entirely. Biogen and Eisai continued amyloid programs that eventually led to controversial FDA approvals, showing the hypothesis retained industry investment despite challenges.

**• Prediction:** *Tau research would expand given amyloid failures* — **ACCURATE**. The late 2010s did see increased tau-focused research investment and clinical programs, even if most ultimately failed.

**• Implicit prediction:** Tau therapies might succeed where amyloid failed — **INACCURATE**. Most tau-targeting drugs subsequently failed in clinical trials, with no tau-based therapy achieving clear success in Alzheimer's disease as of 2024. The field's hope that tau might be a better therapeutic target than amyloid did not materialize in successful treatments.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article captures an important historical inflection point where the Alzheimer's field was pivoting away from amyloid toward tau targets—a shift that seemed logical given repeated amyloid failures but ultimately didn't yield successful therapies. The piece's true value lies not in its tau optimism but in documenting industry sentiment and the cyclical nature of drug development hypotheses.
