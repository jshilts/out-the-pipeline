# Hexacyclinol - Another Request (February 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief post from a chemistry blogger addresses the ongoing controversy surrounding James La Clair's 2006 hexacyclinol synthesis paper. The author acknowledges taking a day off from regular content to moderate discussion around this scientific dispute. The post explicitly asks readers to avoid ad hominem attacks and potentially libelous statements about La Clair personally, while acknowledging that many in the scientific community find it difficult to believe the original paper's claims. The author notes that convincing explanations for the various discrepancies in the reported synthesis have not emerged, but emphasizes keeping the discussion on scientific grounds rather than personal insults. The piece reflects the scientific community's self-regulation mechanisms when facing potential research misconduct or disputed results.

## 2. HISTORY

The hexacyclinol controversy involved a complex natural product synthesis published by James La Clair in 2006 in the *European Journal of Organic Chemistry*. The controversy escalated when other synthetic chemists, notably those in the blogosphere and academic community, raised serious questions about the reported NMR data and the feasibility of the claimed synthesis. 

Subsequent to this 2009 blog post, the scientific community continued to scrutinize the work through proper channels. The case became a notable example of how scientific blogs and online forums can serve as platforms for identifying potential problems in published research before formal retractions occur. The controversy highlighted the evolving role of social media and scientific blogging in post-publication peer review. 

The broader context involved ongoing discussions about research integrity in synthetic organic chemistry and the mechanisms available for challenging published work. This case occurred during a period when the scientific community was increasingly recognizing the value of transparent post-publication review processes alongside traditional peer review.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

This article does not contain predictions about future developments. It is primarily a moderation/editorial note addressing proper conduct in scientific discourse around a disputed piece of research. The author's focus is on maintaining civil scientific debate rather than forecasting outcomes of the controversy or broader trends in the field.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

While the hexacyclinol controversy itself was significant for discussions about research integrity and post-publication review in chemistry, this particular blog post serves primarily as a moderation notice with limited standalone analytical value or broader implications for biotechnology development.
