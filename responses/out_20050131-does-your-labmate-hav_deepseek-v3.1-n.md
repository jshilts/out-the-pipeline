# Does Your Labmate Have the Hands? (January 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary addresses how to evaluate the practical bench skills of chemists, distinguishing genuine competence from superficial indicators. The author argues that knowledge of name reactions and quick blackboard problem-solving can be misleading, as these skills don't always translate to actual laboratory proficiency. Productivity metrics, especially from the combinatorial chemistry era, could be inflated through easy-to-extend analog series rather than true synthetic skill.

The most reliable indicators proposed are reproducibility and the ability to duplicate others' work. Consistent yield discrepancies or reactions that only work for one person are described as red flags. The article recommends using *Organic Syntheses* procedures as a foolproof test for inexperienced chemists, as these are thoroughly vetted, independently verified preparations that reveal true bench competence when attempted.

## 2. HISTORY
The themes raised in this 2005 article have maintained remarkable relevance in pharmaceutical chemistry and broader scientific practice. Reproducibility emerged as a major crisis in science during the 2010s, particularly highlighted by studies showing that many published results could not be reproduced, validating the article's emphasis on this metric.

The combinatorial chemistry boom mentioned in the piece did transition from initial hype to more measured implementation. While high-throughput synthesis remained important, the focus shifted toward quality and drug-likeness over pure compound numbers. Pharmaceutical companies increasingly recognized that producing hundreds of mediocre compounds was less valuable than producing fewer, well-characterized molecules with better drug properties.

*Organic Syntheses* (now with over 90 volumes) has maintained its reputation as the gold standard for reliable procedures, continuing to serve as a training resource and benchmark for synthetic competence.

The broader reproducibility movement in science has led to increased emphasis on detailed experimental procedures, supplementary information, and efforts to address the "replication crisis" - all reinforcing the article's core message about the importance of reproducible work over superficial displays of knowledge.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article doesn't explicitly make forward-looking predictions, but provides evaluative framework suggestions. The implicit assumption that reproducibility would remain important has been validated by subsequent developments in scientific culture and pharmaceutical R&D practices.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **4/10**
The article provides practical insights about scientific evaluation that remain relevant, but its narrow focus on academic/organic chemistry limits broader historical impact on the biotechnology industry.

*Note: The article focuses primarily on organic chemistry evaluation rather than biotechnology industry developments. Its value lies more in scientific methodology than biotech industry forecasting or analysis.*
