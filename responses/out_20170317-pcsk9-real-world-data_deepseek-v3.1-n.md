# PCSK9: Real World Data Arrives, Unfortunately (March 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses PCSK9 inhibitors, a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs developed through genetics-based drug discovery. People with loss-of-function PCSK9 mutations naturally have very low LDL cholesterol without apparent ill effects, making this an excellent drug target. Two major antibody drugs had reached the market: Repatha (evolocumab) from Amgen and a competing drug from Regeneron/Sanofi.

However, the drugs were not achieving the blockbuster sales predicted, mainly because insurance companies were denying coverage due to high prices (around $14,000 annually) and the lack of outcomes data proving cardiovascular benefit. While the drugs effectively lowered LDL cholesterol, payers wanted evidence that this translated to reduced heart attacks, strokes, and deaths before approving coverage over much cheaper statins.

The article focuses on newly released three-year data from Amgen's Repatha showing a 15% relative cardiovascular risk reduction compared to placebo. This fell short of the >20-25% reduction that investors and insurers were hoping for, leading the author to predict continued insurance denials and stock market declines for companies in this space.

## 2. HISTORY

The PCSK9 inhibitor story evolved significantly after 2017 with important clinical, regulatory, and market developments:

### Clinical Outcomes Data
The **FOURIER trial** (Repatha, evolocumab) results published in 2017 showed the 15% relative risk reduction mentioned in the article. However, subsequent analysis revealed more nuanced benefits: the absolute risk reduction was approximately 1.5% over 2.2 years, translating to 137 patients needing treatment for two years to prevent one cardiovascular event.

The **ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial** for Praluent (alirocumab, Regeneron/Sanofi) reported in 2018 showed a 15% relative risk reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events, similar to Repatha's results.

### FDA Regulatory Changes
In 2019, the FDA approved label expansions for both drugs to include cardiovascular risk reduction based on the outcomes trials, not just LDL cholesterol lowering. This was an important regulatory milestone.

### Market Access and Pricing
**Dramatic price reductions occurred** after 2018. By 2019, both manufacturers cut list prices by approximately 60%, bringing annual costs down to around $5,400-5,850. This was partially driven by competitive pressure and payer negotiations.

The **American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association** updated their cholesterol guidelines in 2018 to recommend PCSK9 inhibitors for high-risk patients who cannot reach LDL goals with statins, significantly expanding potential patient populations.

### Real-World Uptake
Despite price reductions, patient access remained challenging due to prior authorization requirements and residual cost barriers. Studies showed that only about 20-30% of eligible patients actually received PCSK9 inhibitors through 2020-2021.

**Annual sales** for both drugs combined reached approximately $2.5-3 billion by 2022-2023, substantial but well below the $10-20 billion peak predictions from the pre-outcomes trial era.

### Generic Competition
The patent landscape evolved with ongoing litigation between manufacturers, but biosimilar competition has begun emerging in recent years, further pressuring prices.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several predictions, both explicitly and implicitly:

• **Insurance companies would continue denying prescriptions**: **ACCURATE**. While guidelines expanded and prices dropped, PCSK9 inhibitors remained subject to strict prior authorization requirements and utilization management through 2024. Patient access remained a significant barrier.

• **Stock market impact on companies in the space**: **PARTIALLY ACCURATE**. PCSK9-focused companies did see stock declines after the 2017 outcomes data, but long-term performance was mixed as companies diversified pipelines and managed pricing expectations.

• **Pricing justification at $14,000**: **INACCURATE** in magnitude but **CORRECT** in principle. The article questioned whether the benefit justified the price. In reality, manufacturers eventually cut prices by ~60% and still achieved meaningful revenue, suggesting the market found equilibrium at lower price points with proven outcomes data.

• **Implied blockbuster forecast not materializing**: **ACCURATE**. The article correctly identified that the drugs wouldn't achieve the multi-billion dollar blockbuster status initially predicted. Combined sales of $2.5-3 billion annually by the early 2020s represented meaningful commercial success but fell well short of the $10-20 billion peak predictions.

• **Does lower LDL really translate to cardiovascular benefit**: **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED**. The outcomes trials confirmed cardiovascular benefit in high-risk populations, validating the LDL hypothesis for this class. However, the magnitude of benefit was modest in absolute terms, supporting the article's skepticism about dramatic impact claims.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrated sharp analytical foresight about the challenges facing genetics-based drug development, accurately identifying the gap between mechanism validation and real-world clinical and commercial success. The PCSK9 story became emblematic of the complex interplay between drug pricing, payer coverage, clinical outcomes evidence requirements, and market adoption challenges - making this commentary relevant far beyond just this drug class.
