# What If Drug Patents Were Written Like Software Patents? (June 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses the US Supreme Court's 9-0 decision in *Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank* (June 2014), which limited the patentability of software inventions that merely implement abstract ideas on generic computers. The author draws an analogy between vague software patents and the absurdity of similarly broad drug patents—imagining a patent claim that would cover virtually any small-molecule enzyme inhibitor without specifying the compound, target, or mechanism. The article frames *Alice* as part of a multi-year effort by the Supreme Court to address problematic patents, alongside earlier decisions like *Mayo v. Prometheus* (2012) and *Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad* (2013).

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following *Alice*, the decision reshaped US software and business-method patent practice. The ruling invalidated large numbers of existing patents and made it substantially harder to obtain new patents on software-related inventions, particularly those involving business methods, financial transactions, or abstract concepts implemented on generic hardware. Lower courts and the USPTO applied *Alice* aggressively, frequently finding software patents ineligible under 35 U.S.C. §101. 

The biotech sector did not face the same broad patent eligibility challenges as software, but diagnostic method patents became more vulnerable following Mayo and subsequent cases. The inter partes review (IPR) process created under the America Invents Act (2011) also gained importance as a tool for challenging weak patents. However, the fundamental distinction remained: drugs typically involve specific chemical structures or compositions, making them more defensible against abstract-idea challenges than software or diagnostic methods tied to natural laws.

The Federal Circuit and Supreme Court did impose limits on gene patents (*Myriad*) and purely conventional diagnostic methods (*Mayo*), but pharmaceutical compound and method-of-treatment patents generally survived these eligibility challenges when properly drafted.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make explicit forward-looking claims, but it reflected expectations common at the time:

- **That courts would continue struggling to define "abstract idea" boundaries**: This proved accurate. Lower courts struggled with inconsistent application of *Alice*, and the Federal Circuit issued numerous divided opinions, leading to ongoing uncertainty about software patent eligibility through the late 2010s.
- **That software patent quality problems required judicial intervention**: *Alice* did reduce low-quality software patents, though some critics argued it went too far, creating unpredictability for legitimate software innovations.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 5/10**

The article contributes a useful analogy between drug and software patent quality, and it identifies the *Alice* decision as a significant policy shift. However, the piece is brief and does not explore deeper questions about patent system design or long-term innovation impacts, limiting its broader importance.
