# The Supply of PhDs (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article examines a graph from an ACS webinar showing PhDs awarded in the US over forty years. The author notes that chemistry PhDs have remained relatively stable in the 2,000-2,400 range annually since 1988, suggesting the employment problem for chemists stems more from reduced demand than oversupply. The article's main concern is the "Biomedical PhD" line, which shows a dramatic climb in the late 1980s/early 1990s, brief leveling off, then another "strong, powerful ascent" starting in 2004 - all while the job market was becoming "vicious."

The article questions what forces are driving this continued expansion of biomedical PhD production despite poor job market conditions, essentially framing it as an unsustainable trend that warrants explanation.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this 2012 article, the biomedical PhD oversupply problem became more widely acknowledged and studied. Several key developments occurred:

**Academic Recognition and Policy Response**: By 2013-2014, major scientific organizations including the NIH began seriously addressing graduate education reform. NIH Director Francis Collins convened a working group that led to the NIH's "Biomedical Research Workforce" report, which acknowledged systemic imbalances. This resulted in policy changes including caps on the number of years graduate students could be supported on NIH training grants.

**Continued Production Despite Known Issues**: Data from the NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates shows biomedical PhDs continued rising through the mid-2010s, peaking around 2016-2017 before showing modest declines. The fundamental mismatch between PhD production and tenure-track faculty positions persisted, with studies showing only 10-15% of biomedical PhDs ultimately securing tenure-track positions.

**Alternative Career Paths Solidified**: The period after 2012 saw greater institutional acceptance and promotion of "alternative careers" for PhDs in industry, science policy, patent law, regulatory affairs, and science communication. Universities began formally incorporating broader career development into PhD programs. However, these career paths remained highly competitive, and the biomedical workforce pipeline continued showing signs of dysfunction.

**COVID-19 Impact**: The pandemic created both disruptions and opportunities - temporary reductions in PhD admissions due to lab closures, followed by concerns about post-pandemic academic job markets becoming even more constrained.

The core issue identified in 2012 - excessive PhD production relative to stable academic positions - largely continued through the subsequent decade, with only modest systemic reforms despite heightened awareness.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article was primarily diagnostic rather than predictive - it identified a concerning trend but made no explicit predictions about future outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7**

The article identifies a persistent, structural problem in scientific training that remained highly relevant throughout the subsequent decade. While focused on a specific chart, it captured a systemic issue that continued generating policy discussions, institutional responses, and ongoing debates about PhD education reform.
