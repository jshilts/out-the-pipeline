# 'Tis Unfortunately the Season (December 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This December 2017 commentary by Derek Lowe highlights the pharmaceutical industry's tendency to announce layoffs and site closures during the Thanksgiving-to-Christmas season. The article focuses on three specific examples: Teva Pharmaceutical's announcement of 14,000 job cuts over two years (which occurred just days after the article), Eli Lilly's substantial headcount reduction in their Discovery Chemistry Research & Technologies department (about 25% at their UK site and additional cuts in Indianapolis), and Dart Neuroscience's complete closure after investing over $700 million in neuroscience drug discovery without generating adequate signs of human memory improvement or motor rehabilitation.

The author notes that larger companies tend to time these announcements strategically, while smaller companies can hit financial walls at any time. Lowe expresses particular skepticism about neuroscience drug discovery, describing memory and cognition as "matte, flat, stealth-bomber black" therapeutic areas despite their vast unmet medical needs. The article carries a tone of experienced frustration with the difficulty of drug discovery, especially in neuroscience.

## 2. HISTORY

The developments described in this article were part of broader trends in the pharmaceutical industry. The Teva layoff announcement mentioned in the article's update was indeed one of the largest in the company's history, reflecting ongoing consolidation and restructuring in the generic drug industry. The Eli Lilly cuts were consistent with the company's broader restructuring announced in September 2017, which included 3,500 job cuts globally and site closures aimed at streamlining operations amid patent cliffs and increased competition.

Dart Neuroscience's closure after a $700 million investment highlighted the persistent challenges in neuroscience drug development. The company's failure, as described by its founder's statement about lack of human memory improvement or motor rehabilitation signs, reflected the reality that cognitive and memory disorders remained extremely difficult therapeutic targets. Neuroscience drug development has continued to face high failure rates in subsequent years, with Alzheimer's disease trials, cognitive enhancement, and memory-related therapeutics consistently proving challenging.

The timing observations about seasonal layoffs proved accurate - the pharmaceutical industry has continued this pattern of announcing major restructuring and job cuts in Q4, often timed to coincide with strategic planning cycles and budget finalization for the following year. This article captured a moment when major pharmaceutical companies were grappling with patent expirations, pipeline challenges, and the need for operational efficiency.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

While this article was primarily observational rather than predictive, it contained several implicit predictions and assessments:

- **Implicit assessment about neuroscience drug discovery difficulty**: The article strongly implied that neuroscience drug discovery, particularly for memory and cognition, would continue to be extremely challenging. This assessment proved accurate - Alzheimer's disease drug development has continued to have very high failure rates, with numerous expensive late-stage trial failures in subsequent years.
- **Implicit prediction about continued industry layoff patterns**: The observation about traditional seasonal layoffs implicitly predicted this pattern would continue, which proved accurate as the pharmaceutical industry has maintained these Q4 announcement cycles.
- **Implicit assessment about business strategy**: The author questioned whether strict business decision-making would have led Dart to avoid neuroscience entirely rather than invest heavily. This highlighted an ongoing tension in drug discovery between unmet medical needs and realistic assessment of therapeutic tractability.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 5/10**

This article captures an important moment in pharmaceutical industry trends and provides accurate insight into the persistent challenges of neuroscience drug development, but its scope is relatively narrow and observational rather than transformative in its analysis.
