# Thinking About Genetics and Disease (June 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary article discusses the complexity of genetic contributions to human disease, reflecting on a blog post by Robert Plenge and a Stanford paper (Boyle et al., 2017) introducing the "omnigenic" model. The author contrasts monogenic disorders (like Friedreich ataxia, Huntington's disease, and cystic fibrosis) where single genes have large effects with complex diseases involving many genes of small effect.

The article explains the omnigenic hypothesis: complex traits are driven by enormous numbers of variants with small effects, where disease risk is propagated through regulatory networks from peripheral genes to a smaller number of core genes with direct disease relevance. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the quantitative biological effect of variants (not just statistical associations), using examples like sickle-cell anemia research and challenges with proteins like frataxin in Friedreich ataxia where even basic protein function remains unclear. The commentary highlights the gap between the promise of rare-disease drug development and the practical challenges of extracting "valuable nuggets" from complex genetic architectures.

## 2. HISTORY

The omnigenic model proposed in 2017 has had significant influence on how the genetics community conceptualizes complex traits, though its empirical validation remains ongoing. GWAS studies have continued to expand dramatically, with sample sizes growing from tens of thousands to millions of participants, revealing thousands of additional loci associated with complex diseases.

CRISPR-based therapies have achieved major milestones since 2017. The most significant success is Casgevy (exagamglogene autotemcel), a CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing therapy approved by the FDA in December 2023 for sickle-cell disease—exactly the proving ground mentioned in the article. This represents the first FDA-approved CRISPR therapy and validates the approach of modifying patient cells rather than germline editing. However, the therapy's high cost (~$2.2 million per patient) and complex treatment protocol limit accessibility.

For Friedreich ataxia, understanding of frataxin's role has advanced, but therapeutic progress has been modest. The protein is now better characterized as involved in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis in mitochondria, but no disease-modifying therapy has been approved. Several small molecules and gene therapy approaches remain in clinical trials, but the prediction that solutions wouldn't come "real soon" has held true.

The pharmaceutical industry's approach to rare diseases has evolved with increased investment but persistent challenges in addressing complex genetic diseases. While gene therapy has seen approvals (e.g., Luxturna for inherited retinal disease, Zolgensma for spinal muscular atrophy), they remain limited to relatively simple monogenic contexts with accessible targets. The broader challenge of polygenic diseases like Alzheimer's and schizophrenia has seen continued struggles—major drug candidates have failed in late-stage trials, validating the article's skepticism about finding single "Alzheimer's genes."

Regulatory network mapping has advanced through initiatives like the ENCODE project and single-cell genomics, but the goal of "detailed mapping of cell-specific regulatory networks" remains incomplete. The complexity of gene-gene interactions and tissue-specific effects continue to challenge translation of GWAS findings into drug targets.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Germline editing prediction**: The article stated that long-term solutions through CRISPR or other DNA-editing techniques would "eventually come along (and be accepted)" but noted people were "understandably jumpy about permanent changes to the human gene pool."
  - **Outcome**: The prediction was partially correct on timeline but wrong on approach. Rather than germline editing (which remains ethically controversial and largely prohibited), the field has focused on somatic cell editing. The approval of Casgevy in 2023 validates the second-best solution mentioned—modifying cells in patients already born. Germline editing remains largely restricted to research contexts due to ethical concerns and technical risks.

• **Rare disease gold rush difficulty**: The author warned that "the valuable nuggets are fiendishly difficult to extract" and that the easy monogenic targets were "mighty thin on the ground."
  - **Outcome**: This has proven largely accurate. While some successes have emerged (particularly for diseases with good animal models and accessible targets), many rare disease programs have struggled. The prediction that traditional therapeutic approaches would face challenges has held—protein-protein interaction inhibitors and transcriptional regulators remain difficult drug targets. However, gene therapy has opened new avenues for previously untreatable conditions.

• **Omnigenic model implications**: The article endorsed the prediction that understanding complex diseases would require "detailed mapping of cell-specific regulatory networks."
  - **Outcome**: Progress has been made but slower than hoped. Single-cell technologies and better functional genomics tools have improved our ability to map networks, but translating these maps into therapies remains challenging. The fundamental insight—that complex traits involve many small-effect variants—has been reinforced by larger GWAS studies, but therapeutic targeting of these networks is still in early stages.

• **Alzheimer's and schizophrenia complexity**: The article stated that searches for single genes for these diseases "were futile, because things just aren't that simple."
  - **Outcome**: Validated by subsequent research. Despite massive GWAS efforts identifying hundreds of risk loci for both diseases, no single gene accounts for more than a small fraction of risk. Major therapeutic programs targeting single mechanisms (beta-amyloid for Alzheimer's, dopamine pathways for schizophrenia) have shown limited success, supporting the polygenic/omnigenic model's importance.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

The article demonstrates strong scientific foresight, accurately anticipating the evolution of genetic medicine while highlighting enduring challenges that remain relevant today. Its balanced assessment of both promise and difficulty in translating genetic insights to therapies has aged well, reflecting sophisticated understanding of drug development realities.
