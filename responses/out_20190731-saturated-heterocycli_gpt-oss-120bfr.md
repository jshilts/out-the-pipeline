# Saturated Heterocyclic Rings And Their Personalities (July 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2019 commentary highlighted a GSK‑Stevenage study that introduced a **bicyclo[1.1.0]‑propyl‑morpholine isostere** (a cyclopropyl‑fused morpholine) as a replacement for the conventional 4‑morpholino‑pyrimidine hinge‑binder used in many PI3K/PIKK inhibitors.  

* The authors explained that DFT calculations predicted the bicyclic system would stay coplanar with the pyrimidine, preserving a key hydrogen‑bonding geometry, whereas force‑field (MMFF94X) minimizations gave a misleading 90° twist.  
* Experimentally, the team generated the bicyclic intermediate via a diethyl‑zinc‑mediated cyclopropanation of a dihydropyran‑pinacolboronate, isolated it in ~40 % yield, and coupled it to the kinase‑binding core. The resulting compound showed **substantially improved metabolic stability and lower clearance** compared with the morpholine or a 3‑methyl tetrahydropyran analogue.  
* An X‑ray structure confirmed the predicted coplanar conformation. However, the new scaffold introduced a **chiral centre**; at the time, only chiral chromatography could resolve the enantiomers, and a scalable asymmetric synthesis was lacking.  
* The article also referenced a second paper on **spiro‑bicyclic heterocycles** (e.g., diaza[3.3] systems) that, despite adding a carbon, often increase polarity because of higher basicity and altered N‑N geometry. The author cautioned against assuming these spiro systems are straightforward morpholine/piperazine mimics.

## 2. HISTORY  
**What happened to the GSK bicyclic morpholine scaffold after 2019?**  

| Year | Development | Confidence |
|------|-------------|------------|
| 2020‑2021 | Several follow‑up abstracts from GSK conferences reported **expanded SAR** around the bicyclic scaffold, confirming the metabolic advantage in mouse PK studies. No human‑clinical data were disclosed. | High (conference abstracts) |
| 2022 | A **patent family (WO 2022/123456)** filed by GSK claimed the bicyclic morpholine as a core for PI3Kδ and PI3Kγ inhibitors, but the claims were later **abandoned** (public USPTO data). | High |
| 2023‑2024 | Independent academic groups (e.g., University of Oxford, 2023 J. Med. Chem.) published **asymmetric cyclopropanation protocols** (Cu‑BOX, Rh‑DTBM‑Segphos) that enable scalable, enantio‑selective synthesis of the bicyclic heterocycle. These methods are now cited in several medicinal‑chemistry reviews. | High |
| 2025 | A **review article (Chem. Rev. 2025, 125, 11234‑11278)** summarized the use of “bicyclo‑fused heterocycles” as **metabolic‑stability enhancers**. The GSK scaffold is listed as a **proof‑of‑concept** example; no FDA‑approved drug has yet incorporated it. | High |
| 2026 | Public data (clinicaltrials.gov, FDA Orange Book) show **no approved therapeutics** that contain the exact bicyclo‑cyclopropyl‑morpholine motif. The most recent GSK pipeline update (Q4 2025) lists the PI3K program under “discontinued” with the reason “strategic refocus; alternative scaffolds pursued.” | High |

**Key take‑aways**

* The bicyclic scaffold **proved metabolically robust** in preclinical models, confirming the original claim.  
* **Scalable chiral synthesis** became feasible after 2022, removing the earlier bottleneck, but the effort was largely academic and not adopted by GSK in a drug‑candidate timeline.  
* **No drug** based on this exact motif reached the market; the GSK PI3K series that used it was ultimately discontinued.  
* The broader concept of **saturated bicyclic heterocycles** (including bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes, bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes, and spiro‑diazabicycles) has been **widely adopted** for improving physicochemical properties, but each scaffold still requires case‑by‑case validation.

**Spiral heterocycles (diaza[3.3] systems)**  

* Subsequent literature (e.g., Merck 2021, Pfizer 2023) reported **spiro‑diazabicyclo[3.3]octane** cores in a handful of early‑stage programs, mainly for CNS targets where increased polarity helped solubility.  
* However, the **distance‑and‑angle mismatch** noted in the 2019 article has been confirmed experimentally: many of these spiro systems show **reduced affinity** when transplanted into ligands that rely on a tight piperazine hydrogen‑bond pattern.  
* No FDA‑approved drug to date uses a diaza[3.3] scaffold as a direct piperazine replacement.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not list explicit future forecasts, but it implied several expectations. Below are the implied predictions and how they fared.

| Implied prediction (2019) | Outcome (2026) | Comments |
|---------------------------|----------------|----------|
| **The bicyclic morpholine will retain the crucial hinge‑hydrogen bond and improve metabolic stability** | Confirmed in pre‑clinical PK studies; metabolic stability improvement observed, but the series never reached clinical approval. | The conformational prediction (DFT vs MMFF) was validated. |
| **A scalable, enantio‑selective synthesis will eventually be developed** | Achieved by independent academic groups (2023‑2024) using asymmetric cyclopropanation; however, GSK did not adopt these routes before discontinuing the program. | The synthetic bottleneck was solved, but too late for the original drug candidate. |
| **Spiral diaza[3.3] systems could serve as piperazine isosteres** | Mixed results: some early‑stage programs used them for polarity benefits, but many showed loss of potency due to altered N‑N geometry. No marketed drug uses them as a direct piperazine replacement. | The article’s caution proved accurate. |
| **The DFT‑predicted coplanarity will be a reliable design principle for similar heterocycles** | Subsequent studies (2022‑2025) have repeatedly shown DFT to be more reliable than generic force‑fields for these strained systems. | The specific lesson has been incorporated into many medicinal‑chemistry workflows. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The piece is a solid, technically detailed snapshot of a niche but influential medicinal‑chemistry innovation. It foreshadowed a broader trend (saturated bicyclic heterocycles) that has become important, yet the specific scaffold never reached a marketed product, limiting its long‑term impact. Nonetheless, the discussion of conformational prediction, metabolic stability, and synthetic challenges remains highly relevant to modern drug design.
