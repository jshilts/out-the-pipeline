# The Old Days, Some Older Than Others (February 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article reflects on a Wall Street Journal piece profiling Leo Sternbach, the discoverer of benzodiazepines (including Valium), and his son Dan Sternbach, who worked at GlaxoSmithKline. The author contrasts the early era of drug discovery—where chemists like Leo Sternbach worked with rudimentary equipment and sometimes tested compounds on themselves—with modern pharmaceutical research practices that emphasize rigorous safety protocols and animal testing before human exposure. The piece includes personal anecdotes from the author, who studied under Dan Sternbach at Duke University in the mid-1980s, and reflects on how the field has evolved from informal, self-experimentation approaches to highly regulated, systematic drug development processes. The article serves as both a historical reflection and a commentary on the dramatic transformation of pharmaceutical research methodology over several decades.

## 2. HISTORY

The period following 2004 saw significant evolution in drug discovery practices, though many trends mentioned in the article continued or accelerated:

**Regulatory Changes:** The FDA and international regulatory agencies continued tightening Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards, making the informal self-experimentation described in Sternbach's era increasingly impossible. The 2004-2010 period saw expanded requirements for preclinical safety testing and early-stage clinical trial design.

**Drug Discovery Evolution:** The industry moved further toward high-throughput screening, combinatorial chemistry, and computational drug design methods. However, many of these approaches did not necessarily increase drug approval rates, with pharmaceutical R&D productivity remaining a significant challenge throughout the 2000s and 2010s.

**Benzodiazepine Landscape:** While Valium (diazepam) and other benzodiazepines remained important medications, concerns about dependence, withdrawal, and cognitive effects led to more cautious prescribing practices. Newer medications in related classes (such as non-benzodiazepine hypnotics like zolpidem) gained market share, though benzodiazepines continued to be widely prescribed for anxiety, insomnia, and other conditions.

**Pharmaceutical Industry Consolidation:** Major pharmaceutical companies, including GlaxoSmithKline (where Dan Sternbach worked), continued mergers and acquisitions throughout the 2000s and 2010s, with many established companies restructuring R&D operations and reducing internal discovery programs.

**Pharmacovigilance Strengthening:** Post-2004 regulations (including FDA Amendments Act of 2007) enhanced post-marketing surveillance requirements, reflecting increased emphasis on long-term drug safety monitoring.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself is more retrospective than predictive, focusing on past-to-present evolution rather than making explicit future predictions. However, some implicit expectations can be identified:

- **Implicit expectation:** The trend toward increasingly regulated and systematic drug discovery would continue → **Outcome:** This indeed continued, with expanded regulatory requirements, electronic data capture systems, and risk-based monitoring becoming standard.

- **Implicit expectation:** The contrast between "old school" experiential drug discovery and modern systematic approaches would persist → **Outcome:** The gap continued to widen, with modern drug discovery becoming increasingly data-driven, though questions about declining R&D productivity remained.

There were no explicit predictions in the article to evaluate against later developments.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 2/10**

While the article provides interesting historical context and personal anecdotes, it lacks forward-looking analysis or discussion of emerging trends that would have made it more significant. The piece is primarily nostalgic reflection rather than substantive commentary on the biotechnology/drug discovery landscape, limiting its long-term interest value for understanding industry evolution.

## 5. ANALYSIS

The article's primary value lies in documenting the lived experience of pharmaceutical research's transition from an artisanal, somewhat informal practice to a highly regulated, systematic discipline. Leo Sternbach's career spanning from 1940 to the modern era—including his role in discovering benzodiazepines, one of the most important drug classes in psychiatry—represents a crucial period in pharmaceutical history.

The contrast between Sternbach's era of self-experimentation and contemporary practices illustrates broader themes about risk, safety, and regulatory evolution in medicine. However, as a 2004 publication, the article missed opportunities to anticipate or analyze the major challenges that would define the subsequent decades: the growing "productivity crisis" in pharmaceutical R&D, the emergence of biologics and precision medicine, the opioid crisis and its implications for CNS drug development, and the increasing role of computational approaches in drug discovery. The personal connection to Dan Sternbach is charming but doesn't yield significant analytical insights into industry trends or scientific developments.
