# The FDA and the Dietary Supplements (February 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2019 commentary critiques the U.S. dietary supplement industry's regulatory framework, particularly the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA), which the author argues created loopholes allowing companies to market products with minimal FDA oversight. The article highlights problems such as mislabeled ingredients (contaminated or undisclosed active ingredients), and notes that the FDA was beginning to increase scrutiny by issuing warning letters to 17 companies making unauthorized Alzheimer's disease treatment claims. The author characterizes the industry as largely unregulated "snake oil" that had grown tenfold since 1994 due to weak enforcement.

## 2. HISTORY

The FDA has indeed continued to increase oversight of dietary supplements in the years following 2019, primarily through enforcement actions rather than legislative reform:

**FDA Actions (2019-2024):**
- Continued issuance of warning letters for companies making disease treatment claims and for products containing undeclared pharmaceutical ingredients (particularly in sexual enhancement, weight loss supplements)
- 2020 guidance documents clarifying requirements for New Dietary Ingredients but no major overhaul of the NDI framework was finalized
- 2022 final rule on mandatory product listing for dietary supplements is under development but not yet implemented
- Increased focus on cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practice) inspections

**Legislative Developments:**
- No significant reform of DSHEA has passed Congress
- Some states have implemented their own regulations
- Various draft bills discussed but none have become law

**Industry Impact:**
- The supplement market has continued to grow, valued at approximately $50+ billion annually by 2024
- High-profile cases included FDA action against companies during COVID-19 for unsubstantiated immune support claims
- Retailers like Amazon and CVS have implemented some voluntary quality standards beyond federal requirements
- Ongoing issues with adulterated sports nutrition and weight loss supplements

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No specific predictions were made in the article beyond the implication that FDA's increased scrutiny should continue.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

While the topic remains relevant to public health and regulation, this type of commentary on dietary supplement oversight was already well-established by 2019, and the article provided limited novel analysis or specific forward-looking insight beyond endorsing ongoing FDA enforcement efforts.
