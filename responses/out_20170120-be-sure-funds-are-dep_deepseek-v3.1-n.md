# Be Sure The Funds Are Deposited (January 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques the pseudoscientific "alkaline pH" theory promoted by Robert O. Young, who claimed that diseases including cancer result from body acidity and can be cured by making the body "alkaline." The author dismisses these claims as false, noting that blood pH is tightly regulated at 7.4 and compartmental pH differences are fundamental to cellular function.

The piece focuses on the tragic case of Naima Houder-Mohammed, a British army officer with untreatable breast cancer who paid \$77,000 to Young's San Diego clinic for sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) injections. She traveled from the UK for these treatments but died three months later. The article reproduces Young's emails demanding assurance that funds were deposited before treatment. At publication, Young was facing legal troubles for his practices. The author argues this case demonstrates why loosening drug approval processes could enable dangerous quackery.

## 2. HISTORY

**Legal Outcomes:**
- **2017**: Robert O. Young faced multiple legal challenges. In **June 2017**, he was found guilty of practicing medicine without a license and ordered to pay \$105 million in a civil lawsuit involving cancer patients.
- **2018**: Young was sentenced to **3 years, 8 months in prison** in California for practicing medicine without a license.
- **2021**: He was released from prison but remained subject to restitution payments and restrictions on practicing medicine.

**Clinic Closure and Ongoing Legal Action:**
Young's "pH Miracle Center" near San Diego was shut down. Multiple former patients filed civil lawsuits seeking damages for fraudulent medical practices and wrongful death claims. Several cases were settled out of court for undisclosed amounts.

**Scientific and Regulatory Context:**
The scientific consensus on pH quackery remained unchanged. The FDA and FTC issued multiple warning letters and consumer alerts about "alkaline water" products and pH-related health claims between 2017-2024. No legitimate clinical evidence emerged supporting Young's theories.

**Response to Broader Regulatory Concerns:**
The article's warnings about deregulation proved prescient in some respects. The 2018 "Right to Try" law allowed terminally ill patients to access unapproved treatments, but with safeguards requiring Institutional Review Board oversight and FDA notification, preventing the emergence of completely unregulated clinics like Young's on a large scale. However, COVID-19 saw increased enforcement actions against fraudulent "alternative" treatments.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained one explicit prediction and several implicit concerns:

- **Explicit prediction**: "It is my fervent hope that he is convicted of the crimes of which he has been accused" → **Prediction accurate**: Young was convicted and imprisoned within 18 months of publication.

- **Implicit concern about deregulation enabling more fraud**: The author warned that loosening approval processes could "enable a thousand more Robert Youngs" → **Partially accurate**: While "Right to Try" passed, it retained oversight mechanisms. However, during COVID-19, numerous unproven treatments proliferated (hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin controversies), demonstrating that regulatory challenges remain when urgent health crises create desperation.

- **Implicit prediction about scientific consensus**: The pH theory would remain disproven → **Accurate**: No legitimate scientific evidence emerged supporting alkaline therapy for cancer treatment. Major cancer organizations (ACS, NCI) continued debunking these claims through 2024.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8/10**

This article combines effective science communication exposing dangerous medical fraud with important policy commentary about regulatory safeguards. The subsequent conviction and imprisonment of Young validated its investigative elements, while the broader warnings about balancing innovation with patient protection remain relevant as gene therapies and other advanced treatments raise new regulatory questions.
