# Here and There (13 Jan 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

This blog post discusses three separate topics related to medicine and biotechnology. The first and most substantial section addresses the secretin-for-autism phenomenon, recounting how the hormone secretin became explosively popular as an autism treatment after anecdotal reports, despite lacking rigorous clinical evidence. Prices reportedly surged from ~$30 to $2,000 as desperate parents sought the treatment. The author highlights predatory behavior including the sale of fraudulent "herbal secretin" products. The post also touches on a debate about whether drug regulation should allow market-based efficacy determination rather than requiring controlled trials, and concludes that human desperation makes such approaches unworkable. The second topic contrasts historical and modern mortality patterns using professional athletes' death records, emphasizing progress against infectious diseases. Lastly, the post mentions Charles Murtaugh's return to blogging.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2004 post, the scientific evidence against secretin's efficacy in autism treatment solidified considerably. Multiple randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials conducted through the early-to-mid 2000s consistently failed to demonstrate any benefit for autistic symptoms. Major studies included those published in prominent journals by researchers at several academic medical centers.

The clinical trial data ultimately led to broad scientific consensus that secretin provides no therapeutic benefit for autism spectrum disorders. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other professional organizations issued statements and guidelines reflecting this conclusion. Public interest and demand for secretin treatments declined substantially as these findings became widely known among healthcare providers and patient communities.

No secretin-based therapy has received FDA approval for autism treatment, though the hormone continues to be used for legitimate medical purposes such as pancreatic function testing and certain gastrointestinal diagnostic procedures. The market for off-label secretin for autism collapsed once robust negative evidence accumulated. The predatory practices described in the article - including "herbal secretin" products and price gouging - became less visible as mainstream medical acceptance of the therapy disappeared, though they illustrate persistent challenges in regulating unproven treatments for desperate patient populations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Implicit prediction that secretin's popularity would decline if science didn't support it**: On this point, the author's caution was validated by later events. Research findings did emerge showing secretin to be ineffective for autism, and its use for this purpose subsequently declined. This constitutes accurate foresight about the trajectory once robust evidence accumulated.

• **Central question about whether efficacy should be determined through the market rather than controlled trials**: The author's expressed skepticism about letting efficacy "be sorted out in the marketplace" was largely borne out. The secretin example actually illustrates why rigorous clinical trials remain essential - market dynamics can perpetuate ineffective treatments when driven by desperation rather than evidence.

• **Postrel discussion referenced potential policy changes toward phase I safety trials only**: This policy direction was not actually adopted. FDA regulatory requirements remained in place, and no significant movement toward deregulation occurred. The dual requirement for demonstrated safety and efficacy before marketing approval continued as the established framework.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 5/10**

While the specific secretin episode has largely concluded, the post raises broader themes about desperation-driven medicine and evidence standards that remain highly relevant today. The social dynamics it describes recur in other contexts, making it moderately interesting for understanding how unproven treatments gain traction. However, as the specific case has faded from prominence and the regulatory questions didn't lead to major changes, it ranks as moderately interesting rather than highly impactful.
