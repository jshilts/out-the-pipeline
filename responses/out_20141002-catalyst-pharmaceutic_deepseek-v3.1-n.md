# Catalyst Pharmaceuticals and Their Disgusting Business Strategy (October 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article criticizes Catalyst Pharmaceuticals for pursuing what the author calls a "disgusting business strategy"—taking an existing, widely available drug (3,4-diaminopyridine, the active ingredient in Firdapse) that had been used off-label for free or at minimal cost to treat Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS), and securing FDA orphan drug approval to charge $80,000 annually for essentially the same medication.

The author describes this as exploitation of a regulatory loophole rather than genuine innovation, arguing that Catalyst did no development work, made no improvements to efficacy or safety, but simply took over an existing clinical trial and planned to use orphan drug exclusivity to prevent cheaper alternatives. The piece connects this to similar price hikes on colchicine and hydroxyprogesterone, and mentions Martin Shkreli's recent removal as CEO of Retrophin after their own controversial Thiola price increase.

## 2. HISTORY

**Catalyst's FDA Approval and Market Entry:** Catalyst Pharmaceuticals did receive FDA approval for Firdapse (amifampridine) for LEMS treatment, but this occurred later than the 2014 article suggests—in November 2018, not immediately following the piece. The company established the high pricing strategy as anticipated.

**Real Patient Impact:** LEMS patients faced the exact scenario described in the article. A drug that had been available through compounding pharmacies or the NIH's compassionate use program at minimal cost became prohibitively expensive. Insurance coverage became a major barrier, causing significant disruption to patient care. The $80,000 annual price tag materialized essentially as predicted.

**Jacobus Pharmaceutical and Competing Solutions:** A notable development occurred when Jacobus Pharmaceutical, which had previously provided the medication through the compassionate use program, pursued its own FDA approval pathway for a competing formulation. In May 2022, the FDA granted orphan drug exclusivity protections to Catalyst's competitor Ruzurgi (amifampridine) produced by Jacobus, but only for pediatric LEMS patients ages 6 to under 17 years—a partial victory that preserved Catalyst's adult monopoly while providing a path for pediatric access.

**Limited FDA Regulatory Changes:** The FDA did not fundamentally reform its orphan drug policies in ways that would prevent similar scenarios. The system continued to provide market exclusivity incentives as originally designed, meaning the "regulatory failure" identified in the article persisted. The agency's stance remained that formal approval processes justify protection regardless of prior off-label availability.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction: Catalyst would succeed in charging $80,000 annually for Firdapse**
  - **Outcome: ✓ ACCURATE** - This pricing level was indeed implemented following FDA approval

- **Prediction: This business model would be repeated "over and over, with every single drug that it can be done to"**
  - **Outcome: ✓ PARTIALLY ACCURATE** - While not every eligible drug followed this pattern, multiple examples emerged including similar strategies with older medications repurposed as orphan drugs

- **Prediction: Public backlash would affect the entire pharmaceutical industry**
  - **Outcome: ✓ ACCURATE** - This contributed to already growing public anger over drug pricing that intensified throughout the late 2010s and influenced broader policy debates

- **Prediction: Regulators and legislators would face scrutiny over these practices**
  - **Outcome: ✓ ACCURATE** - Congressional hearings and investigations into drug pricing increased, though concrete legislative changes remained limited during the following years

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This article correctly identified a problematic business model and predicted its real-world consequences with notable accuracy, making it prescient in its field. However, the core phenomenon described—orphan drug pricing strategies—represents a specific, somewhat narrow aspect of pharmaceutical industry practices rather than a transformative development.

**Note:** The author was writing under the assumption that FDA approval was imminent in October 2014, when actual approval occurred four years later in November 2018. This timing discrepancy affects the immediate relevance but not the fundamental accuracy of the analysis.
