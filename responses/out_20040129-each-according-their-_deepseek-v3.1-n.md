# From Each According To Their Creativity, To Each According To Their Difficulty? (January 2004)

## 1. Summary

The article responds to economist Alex Tabarrok's 2004 proposal to adjust patent terms based on the R&D costs invested in innovation. Under this system, patents requiring expensive, difficult research would receive longer protection periods, while low-cost innovations would have shorter terms, theoretically allowing expensive research to recoup costs while preventing cheap ideas from being over-protected.

The author acknowledges the abstract appeal of this cost-based approach but expresses strong skepticism about practical implementation. The core concerns raised are: (1) massive incentives for companies to inflate and manipulate R&D cost reporting—particularly in pharmaceuticals where each extra patent year can mean hundreds of millions in revenue; (2) the inherent difficulty and "voodoo component" of accurately allocating costs to specific projects in an industry with shared resources, fluctuating personnel, and bulk purchasing; and (3) the complexity of drug patents which involve multiple overlapping protections (composition, formulation, treatment methods) each with different cost structures. The author concludes this would create a "Cost Accountant and Patent Lawyer Full Employment Act" generating expensive bureaucracy without advancing actual research.

## 2. History

The patent system did not adopt cost-based term adjustments in the twenty years since this article's publication. Instead, several alternative approaches emerged to address innovation incentives while avoiding the implementation problems the author identified:

**Pharmaceutical Patent Term Extensions (pre-existing and continuing):** The Hatch-Waxman Act's patent term restoration provisions (Section 156) continued to provide up to 5 years of additional patent life for drugs delayed by regulatory approval, while requiring detailed regulatory submissions but not general R&D cost accounting. Pediatric extensions provided an additional 6 months for conducting pediatric studies. These targeted extensions did not require the comprehensive cost tracking the author warned would be problematic.

**Patent Examination and Quality Focus:** Moving away from early-2000s concerns about patent thickets and term gamesmanship, the USPTO increasingly emphasized patent quality over quantity. Initiatives like the Post-Grant Review process (established under the America Invents Act, 2011-2013) and enhanced subject matter eligibility guidance sought to reduce low-quality patents rather than expand term variability.

**Drug Pricing Debates and Transparency Efforts:** Beginning around 2015, public pressure and policy makers increasingly demanded R&D cost transparency to justify pharmaceutical prices, but major companies resisted detailed disclosure citing competitive sensitivity. Congressional hearings and state-level initiatives (like California's drug price transparency law, SB-17 in 2017) requested cost data but faced limited compliance. Medicare drug price negotiation provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act (2022) bypassed cost-based pricing entirely, instead using market mechanisms and therapeutic alternatives for price setting.

**Clinical Trial Reporting Requirements:** Beginning in 2007 with the FDA Amendments Act, expanded clinical trial registration and results reporting requirements increased transparency around development timelines and regulatory milestones without mandating comprehensive cost allocation systems. The emphasis remained on outcomes and safety rather than cost quantification for patent purposes.

## 3. Predictions

**Prediction 1:** Implementing cost-based patent terms would create a "powerful incentive to hocus one's R&D figures" and become the "Cost Accountant and Patent Lawyer Full Employment Act."
- **Outcome:** This system was not adopted, so direct testing is limited. However, when R&D cost transparency later became relevant for drug pricing debates, companies demonstrated reluctance to disclose detailed cost data, citing proprietary concerns. The pharmaceutical industry's consistent opposition to mandatory cost reporting suggests the predicted gaming behavior would likely have materialized if implemented.

**Prediction 2:** "Every possible means to preserve or extend the patent's term is invoked" regarding existing patent term extensions.
- **Outcome:** Completely accurate. Throughout the 2000s-2020s, pharmaceutical companies aggressively pursued every available extension mechanism: citizen petitions to delay generics, authorized generics strategies, REMS restrictions limiting generic access, secondary patents on formulations and delivery methods, and strategic use of pediatric extensions. The author's observation about maximizing enclosure of patent protection through available mechanisms became even more pronounced, particularly litigation over "skinny labeling" for method-of-use patents and settlements involving delayed generic entry.

**Prediction 3:** The complexity of multiple overlapping patents for a single drug (composition, formulation, methods) each with different cost structures would make practical implementation "insane."
- **Outcome:** Additional evidence supporting this concern emerged through patent linkage systems. The complexity of coordinating protection across primary composition patents, secondary formulation patents, polymorph patents, and method-of-treatment patents created extensive legal costs and disputes. The Federal Trade Commission's pay-for-delay investigations in the 2000s-2010s revealed sophisticated strategies to delay competition using overlapping patent protections, suggesting a cost-based system would have added another layer of complexity without fundamentally changing behavior.

## 4. Interest

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates remarkable prescience in identifying implementation barriers to a seemingly appealing policy proposal, correctly predicting the risks of manipulation and bureaucratic burden—all rooted in practical pharmaceutical industry experience rather than economic abstraction.
