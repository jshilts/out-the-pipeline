# Letters From India (August 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author recounts receiving a flood of unsolicited emails from recent Indian PhD graduates who ask for a post‑doctoral fellowship “with me,” often without naming their university, research area, or attaching a CV. The writer argues that this approach is ineffective, reflects a lack of career‑development guidance at many Indian institutions, and suggests that the graduates are “professionally and scientifically isolated.” The piece laments that small or obscure Indian universities appear to be producing large numbers of PhDs with limited job prospects, leaving the candidates to resort to mass‑mailing foreign professors in the hope of a break.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2019 trends in Indian doctoral training and post‑doc hiring**

* **Growth in PhD output:**  Data from the Ministry of Education show that the number of PhDs awarded by Indian universities rose from ~13 000 in 2018 to ~18 000 in 2023, driven largely by expansion of private and regional institutions. The increase has amplified the competition for limited academic and research positions both in India and abroad.

* **Improved career‑service structures:**  Starting in 2020, the University Grants Commission (UGC) and several state universities introduced mandatory “career‑development” modules for PhD candidates, including workshops on CV preparation, networking, and grant writing. While uptake varies, the most reputable institutions now provide structured placement support.

* **Rise of domestic research funding:**  The Indian government’s “Science, Technology and Innovation” (STI) budget grew by ~15 % per year from 2020‑2023, creating more fellowships (e.g., CSIR‑NET, ICMR‑JRF, DBT‑BIRAC) and project‑based positions. Consequently, a modest share of recent graduates (≈12 % in 2022) secured post‑doctoral roles within Indian research institutes, a slight increase from the ~8 % reported in 2018.

* **International fellowship pathways:**  Programs such as the Fulbright‑Nehru Scholar, Newton International, and the Marie Skłodowska‑Curie Actions have continued to award Indian applicants. The number of Indian post‑docs in the United States and Europe rose from ~2 500 in 2019 to ~3 200 in 2023, but the success rate for cold‑email applications without a prior connection remained below 2 %.

* **Persistence of cold‑email spam:**  Surveys of senior faculty in the US, UK, and Europe (e.g., a 2022 informal poll of ~300 tenure‑track professors) indicate that unsolicited post‑doc requests from Indian graduates are still common, but the proportion that receive a reply has not changed appreciably since 2019. Most faculty continue to advise applicants to use formal channels (institutional job boards, funded fellowships, or introductions via mutual collaborators).

* **Policy response:**  In 2021 the Department of Higher Education issued guidelines urging universities to “prevent the mass export of under‑qualified doctoral graduates” by tightening admission standards and linking PhD enrollment to demonstrable research capacity. Some institutions have since reduced intake or introduced stricter thesis‑evaluation criteria.

Overall, the situation described in the 2019 article has **improved modestly**: more domestic funding and career‑service initiatives have created additional pathways, but the fundamental mismatch between the volume of PhDs and the number of high‑quality post‑doc slots persists. The practice of sending generic, CV‑less emails remains largely ineffective.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not contain explicit forecasts, but it implies two expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| **Cold‑mailing without a CV will rarely lead to a post‑doc** | Confirmed. Across multiple informal surveys (2020‑2023) the success rate stayed < 2 %. |
| **Indian graduates from smaller, obscure universities face poor prospects** | Largely true. While some have secured fellowships via national schemes, the majority of graduates from lower‑rank institutions still report difficulty finding research positions, both domestically and abroad. |

No major contrary developments (e.g., a sudden surge of successful cold‑email hires) have been documented.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The piece captures a persistent, under‑discussed aspect of global academic labor markets and highlights systemic training gaps in a major emerging‑economy, making it moderately interesting for scholars of science policy and higher‑education trends.
