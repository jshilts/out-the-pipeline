# Chemistry, The Movie! (December 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief blog post from Science Magazine's website shares a humorous list of chemistry-themed movie title puns that were circulating on Twitter under the hashtag #ChemistryTheMovie. Examples provided include "Boron Free", "The Wizard of Osmium", "The Bench Connection", and "Weekend at Swernie's" (a pun on the Swern oxidation reaction). The article serves as light entertainment, directing readers to a website (orgoflash.com) and Twitter for more chemistry-related movie title jokes.

## 2. HISTORY
The #ChemistryTheMovie meme represents a typical example of early 2010s social media science humor that flourished on Twitter when the platform was still primarily text-based. The referenced website orgoflash.com appears to no longer be actively maintained, which reflects the transient nature of many niche internet communities and humor sites from that era. This type of chemistry pun content has continued in various forms, with similar wordplay appearing on platforms like Reddit's r/chemistry and other science communication channels. The specific meme itself had limited lasting impact beyond providing momentary entertainment for chemistry students and professionals, though it exemplified a broader trend of scientists using social media for community-building and humor. The approach of creating science-themed parody content has persisted and evolved, with many science YouTubers, TikTok creators, and educational content producers continuing to use humor to engage audiences with scientific concepts.
