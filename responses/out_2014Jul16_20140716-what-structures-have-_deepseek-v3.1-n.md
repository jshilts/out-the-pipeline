# Analysis of "What Structures Have Turn on You?" (Science Magazine, July 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief article by Derek Lowe discusses the subjective and inconsistent nature of medicinal chemists' structural preferences when evaluating compound libraries. The author notes that while every medicinal chemist will reject certain molecular structures from screening hits or compound collections, there's surprisingly little agreement between individual chemists about which structures should be eliminated. 

The central thesis is that personal negative experiences create "Fooled me once" biases that override objective criteria. Lowe shares his own aversions to NH pyrroles, napthalene derivatives, and Mannich products based on past "nasty experiences" rather than systematic analysis. While some problematic compound classes like rhodanines achieve broader consensus, the article highlights how individual traumas with specific scaffolds create inconsistent, experience-based filters that vary considerably between chemists. The piece serves as a thoughtful meditation on how scientific judgment contains more subjectivity and personal history than practitioners typically acknowledge.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent to this 2014 article, several significant trends emerged in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery:

**Rise of Data-Driven Approaches (2015-2020)**: The pharmaceutical industry increasingly adopted computational and machine learning approaches to move beyond individual chemist biases. Tools like matched molecular pairs analysis, cheminformatics databases (ChEMBL, PubChem), and predictive ADMET models began systematically cataloging problematic structural features based on large-scale data rather than individual experience.

**AI and Machine Learning Integration (2017-present)**: Deep learning models trained on massive compound libraries started identifying structural alerts and pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS) more systematically. Companies like Atomwise, Exscientia, and BenevolentAI developed algorithms that could flag problematic scaffolds across thousands of assays, providing more objective criteria.

**Continued Rhodanine Controversy**: Interestingly, the rhodanine debate Lowe mentioned continued actively. Subsequent studies (2015-2019) confirmed that while many rhodanines show promiscuous binding and assay interference, some could be developed into legitimate drugs when properly optimized with good selectivity profiles. This nuance reinforced Lowe's point that even universally-suspected structures deserved individualized evaluation.

**PAINS Filters Standardization**: The PAINS concept, developed around 2010, became more standardized in pharmaceutical workflows, with systematic databases identifying frequent hitters and aggregators across multiple assays.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**What the Article Got Right:**
- The subjectivity of medicinal chemistry judgment persisted and became even more apparent with standardization efforts
- Personal experience continued influencing drug discovery decisions despite increased computational tools
- The tension between data-driven approaches and individual expertise remained unresolved
- Problematic compound classes like rhodanines (and newer ones like certain azaindoles and hydroxypyridones) continued generating controversy

**What the Article Underestimated:**
- The speed and impact of AI/machine learning in systematizing structural alerts
- The degree to which large pharmaceutical companies would adopt systematic filtering approaches
- The power of massive compound databases to create semi-objective criteria that could override individual chemist preferences

**What the Article Overlooked:**
- The emergence of new problematic structural classes that weren't on the radar in 2014
- The inverse problem: structures that looked suspicious but performed well systematically (false positive filters)
- The economic drivers pushing companies toward automated, less-biased screening approaches to reduce failed programs

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 5/9**

This article ranks in the 50-60th percentile of interest for several reasons:

**Strengths raising its score:**
- **Lasting relevance**: The core insight about subjective biases in scientific judgment remains highly relevant
- **Meta-cognitive value**: Successfully predicted that individual experiences would continue influencing supposedly objective scientific decisions
- **Timeless principle**: The "Fooled me once" heuristic applies broadly beyond medicinal chemistry to many technical fields

**Factors limiting higher score:**
- **Narrow domain**: Specifically addresses medicinal chemistry rather than broader scientific principles that could engage wider audiences
- **Limited actionable insight**: While accurately describing the problem, offers little guidance for systematic improvement
- **Modest conceptual novelty**: Acknowledged existing knowledge about medicinal chemistry biases rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts
- **Predictive value**: Correctly identified the persistence of the problem but couldn't anticipate the technological solutions that emerged

**Historical significance**: The article gains importance primarily through the lens of 2024 where AI/machine learning approaches are attempting to solve exactly the bias problems Lowe described. Its prescient documentation of the "before times" before systematic computational filtering gives it retroactive value as a historical marker of a transition period in drug discovery methodology.
