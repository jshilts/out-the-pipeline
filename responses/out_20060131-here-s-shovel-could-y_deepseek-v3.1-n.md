# Here's A Shovel. Could You Dig Yourself In Some More? (January 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is a personal anecdote about the author's experience with a particularly difficult "reaction-quiz" job interview back in 1989. The interviewer, after noting the author's postdoctoral work with free-radical chemist Bernd Giese, asked him to name his "ten favorite free-radical chemists." When the author struggled to list names, the interviewer challenged one of his choices (chemist "Z") and demanded he draw out reactions from a recent paper by that researcher.

The interview proceeded in this adversarial, "gotcha" style, leaving the author feeling he had performed poorly and would not receive a job offer. The article frames this as an example of how reaction-quiz interviews were unnecessarily hostile and often assessed trivia rather than scientific ability, celebrating their apparent disappearance.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent to this 2006 article, changes in job interview practices in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors continued, with many organizations moving away from technical "gotcha" questions toward more practical and collaborative assessments. The widespread adoption of behavioral interviewing, structured competency-based questions, and work-sample tests (where candidates solve realistic problems) has become more common.

However, some technical assessment persists, particularly for research roles, but typically in more structured forms such as timed coding challenges, case studies, or open-ended discussions about scientific approaches rather than memorization-based quizzing.

The key development has been the recognition that interviewing should predict job performance rather than simply test recall of obscure facts. Many companies now use standardized rubrics, panel interviews, and real-world problem solving to evaluate candidates. This shift has been driven by both practical experience (like the author's) and research in industrial/organizational psychology showing that unstructured, adversarial interviews have poor predictive validity for job success.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No explicit predictions appear in the article.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 2/10**

Adds little new insight compared to the previous interview article and focuses on a minor personal anecdote with limited broader implications for biotechnology.
