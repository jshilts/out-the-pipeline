I'll analyze this 2012 article about the Elsevier boycott using the provided template.

# An Elsevier Boycott (February 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes a growing academic boycott against Elsevier journals that began in the mathematics community, led by Fields Medalist Timothy Gowers. The boycott protested Elsevier's high subscription prices, bundling practices that forced institutions to purchase unwanted journals, and the company's support for the Research Works Act—legislation that would restrict public access to federally-funded research. The movement had established a central website (thecostofknowledge.com) and was gaining momentum, though the article noted that biomedical fields where Elsevier's Cell Press and The Lancet are influential would be the real test of the boycott's success. The author expressed skepticism about the sustainability of the traditional scientific publishing model.

## 2. HISTORY

**The boycott movement gained substantial traction.** By 2016, the costofknowledge.com site had collected over 17,000 researcher signatures pledging not to publish in, referee for, or do editorial work for Elsevier journals. The movement significantly raised awareness about academic publishing costs and accessibility issues.

**Research Works Act was defeated.** Within months of this article, in February 2012, Elsevier withdrew support for the Research Works Act following widespread opposition, and the legislation died. This was a major victory for open access advocates.

**Major policy shifts followed.** In 2013, the Obama administration mandated that federally-funded research must be made publicly accessible within one year of publication. The European Union implemented similar policies through Horizon 2020 requirements. In 2016, the Gates Foundation also adopted open access mandates.

**Continuing escalation of boycotts.** In 2019, the University of California system—one of the largest research institutions globally—canceled its Elsevier subscription worth over $10 million annually after failing to reach an agreement for open access publishing. This was followed by similar cancellations by other major institutions including MIT and Carnegie Mellon.

**The rise of Plan S.** In 2018, a coalition of European funders launched Plan S, requiring that by 2021 all publicly-funded research be published in open access venues. This represents the most aggressive policy shift away from the traditional subscription model.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions:

• **Traditional publishing model is unsustainable** - The author stated "the current system of scientific publishing is increasingly outmoded, although I'm loath to forecast what will replace it." **This proved accurate.** Subscription cancellations by major institutions, funder mandates, and the growth of open access models have fundamentally challenged the traditional system, though a complete replacement hasn't emerged yet.

• **Biomedical field participation crucial** - The article noted that "a real test of this movement will be to see how many people from these fields it can attract" regarding Cell Press and The Lancet. **This proved prescient.** While exact participation numbers are difficult to measure, biomedical researchers have increasingly embraced open access publishing, with Public Library of Science (PLOS) becoming a major force and many traditional biomedical publishers adopting hybrid open access options.

• **Movement gaining momentum** - The author observed the boycott "continues to gain publicity." **This was accurate.** The movement expanded significantly beyond mathematics, with major institutional actions and policy changes occurring in subsequent years.

## 4. INTEREST 

**Rating: 7/10**

This article identified a critical inflection point in academic publishing that has had lasting impact. While focused on a specific boycott, it captured the beginning of fundamental changes to how scientific research is disseminated, with major policy shifts and institutional actions still unfolding today.
