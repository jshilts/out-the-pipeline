# Once More Into the CETP, Friends (April 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article lamented the long string of failures of cholesteryl‑ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors—drugs that raise HDL‑cholesterol but have repeatedly shown no cardiovascular benefit. It highlighted a 2015 post‑hoc analysis of the failed Roche drug **dalcetrapib** that identified a subgroup of patients carrying a particular **ADCY9** genotype (rs1967309) who appeared to enjoy a 39 % lower rate of cardiovascular events, whereas the opposite genotype fared worse.  

The author argued that this pharmacogenomic signal could resurrect the CETP field if a new, genotype‑selected trial were funded. A Montreal spin‑out, **DalCor**, was said to be recruiting for a 5,000‑patient, genotype‑guided Phase III study, having raised roughly $150 million of the $250 million needed. The piece speculated that a successful interim read‑out could attract a “big‑pharma” partner and finally prove CETP inhibition’s worth for the genetically defined responders.

## 2. HISTORY  

**CETP inhibitor landscape after 2016**  

| Year | Event | Outcome |
|------|-------|---------|
| **2015** | **ACCELERATE** (evacetrapib, Eli Lilly) halted for futility. | No cardiovascular benefit; program discontinued. |
| **2017** | **REVEAL** (anacetrapib, Merck) published. | 9 % relative risk reduction in major coronary events, but modest absolute benefit and a long drug‑half‑life that raised safety concerns. Merck decided not to pursue regulatory approval; anacetrapib was abandoned. |
| **2017‑2020** | No new large‑scale CETP Phase III trials launched. | Industry focus shifted to PCSK9 inhibitors, RNA‑based lipid therapies, and anti‑inflammatory approaches. |
| **2018** | **DalCor** announced plans for a genotype‑guided trial (often referred to as “DAL‑GEN”). | The trial never entered enrollment; the company failed to secure the remaining funding. |
| **2020** | DalCor re‑branded as **CETP Therapeutics** and sought partnership with a major pharma. | No partnership materialized; the company’s pipeline was wound down. |
| **2021‑2022** | The ADCY9 rs1967309 finding was re‑examined in independent cohorts (e.g., the **PROSPER** and **JUPITER** datasets). | Results were inconsistent; the effect size was not reproducible at a genome‑wide significance level. |
| **2023** | A meta‑analysis of all CETP inhibitor trials (including genotype‑subgroup data) concluded that any benefit was limited to a very small, poorly defined population, insufficient to justify further large‑scale development. | Consensus among cardiology societies: CETP inhibition is not a viable therapeutic strategy. |
| **2024‑2025** | Research on CETP continues in academic labs, mainly as a tool to understand HDL biology, but no commercial programs are active. | No new CETP‑targeting drugs in the pipeline; the field is considered “dormant.” |

**Key take‑aways**

* The genotype‑guided hypothesis never progressed beyond exploratory analyses.  
* DalCor/CETP Therapeutics did not complete the 5,000‑patient trial and ultimately ceased operations (or pivoted to unrelated projects).  
* The only CETP inhibitor that showed a modest benefit (anacetrapib) was not pursued for market approval, effectively ending the commercial pursuit of CETP inhibition.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made in the article | What actually happened |
|--------------------------------|------------------------|
| **A 5,000‑patient, ADCY9‑selected Phase III trial would be launched and funded.** | The trial was never initiated; funding fell short and the study was cancelled. |
| **Interim data would be “promising” enough to attract a big‑pharma partnership.** | No partnership was announced; major pharma companies continued to abandon CETP programs. |
| **Genotype‑guided CETP inhibition could revive the target and lead to a new class of cardiovascular drugs.** | Subsequent analyses failed to replicate the ADCY9 signal robustly; the target remained unattractive to investors and regulators. |
| **A sizable fraction of the population (≈20 %) would be eligible for the genotype‑selected therapy.** | The allele frequency of rs1967309 is indeed ~20 % in Europeans, but the clinical effect size could not be confirmed, so no therapeutic indication was created. |

Overall, none of the article’s forward‑looking expectations materialized.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 5/10**  

The piece is a useful snapshot of the optimism that pharmacogenomics could rescue a failing therapeutic area, but the subsequent history shows that the specific CETP‑ADCY9 story did not pan out, limiting its long‑term relevance.
