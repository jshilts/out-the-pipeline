# We Were Ahead of the Crowd (September 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short commentary notes that, by 2012, the periodic table had moved from a classroom staple to a pop‑culture icon.  The author cites a Wall Street Journal piece describing the table’s appearance on TV shows, T‑shirts, and other consumer goods.  He highlights Theodore Gray’s coffee‑table book *The Elements* (which had sold about 650 000 copies at the time) and the emergence of a high‑end “periodic‑table” furniture piece made of burred oak with inlaid element samples, priced at roughly $8 550.  The article also mentions practical restrictions (e.g., fluorine, chlorine, and bromine cannot be shipped on airplanes) and muses about possible DIY extensions such as ampoule‑based tables.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Cultural persistence.**  Over the decade after 2012 the periodic table continued to be used as a design motif.  Merchandise such as shower curtains, mugs, T‑shirts, and wall posters remained widely available on major e‑commerce platforms (Amazon, Etsy, Redbubble).  No major “boom” or “collapse” occurred; sales have been steady, driven largely by education‑related gifts and novelty‑seeker markets.

**Theodore Gray’s book.**  *The Elements* stayed in print and saw a second, expanded edition released in 2019 (titled *The Elements: A Visual Exploration of the Periodic Table*).  The newer edition added updated graphics and a few additional elements (e.g., tennessine, oganesson) and was marketed to both general readers and high‑school teachers.  While exact cumulative sales figures are not publicly disclosed, the book continues to rank among the top‑selling popular‑science titles on Amazon’s “Chemistry” category, indicating sustained demand.

**High‑end periodic‑table furniture.**  The bespoke oak table described in the article remained a niche luxury item.  No evidence shows that it spawned a broader market for “element‑inlaid” furniture; the concept has largely stayed within specialty design blogs and occasional museum gift‑shop displays.  The price point and the logistical challenges of shipping hazardous‑element samples have limited wider adoption.

**Safety and regulation.**  The restrictions on transporting reactive gases such as fluorine, chlorine, and bromine on commercial aircraft have not changed.  Likewise, regulations governing the sale of radioactive material (e.g., depleted uranium) to private individuals remain stringent, so the author’s speculation about “radioactive” table pieces never materialized in mainstream consumer products.

**Broader scientific impact.**  The article’s focus on cultural diffusion did not intersect with any major biotech or pharmaceutical developments.  No drug‑discovery programs or biotech startups were launched based on the popularity of the periodic table itself.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The piece contains a few implicit forecasts; they are listed below with an assessment of how they panned out.

| Implicit prediction | What actually happened |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| **The periodic table will become a mainstream design element, appearing on everyday items (shower curtains, clothing, home décor).** | Accurate.  Such items are still sold in large numbers; the motif is commonplace in novelty‑gift catalogs and online marketplaces. |
| **A high‑priced, inlaid‑element furniture piece will find a market among affluent consumers.** | Only partially realized.  The specific oak table remains a one‑off luxury; no sizable market for similar products has emerged. |
| **Restrictions on shipping reactive gases (F, Cl, Br) will limit the feasibility of “complete” tables that include these elements.** | Correct.  Airline and postal regulations have not been relaxed, so any commercial product that includes those gases is still prohibited. |
| **Interest in the periodic table will spur further public‑science publishing (e.g., more books like Gray’s).** | Largely true.  The 2019 expanded edition of *The Elements* and several other visually‑rich periodic‑table books (e.g., *The Periodic Table: A Visual Guide* by DK) were released, indicating continued publisher confidence. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 3/10** – The article is a light‑hearted cultural observation with limited lasting scientific or industry relevance; its primary value lies in documenting a moment of pop‑culture enthusiasm rather than forecasting substantive biotech or policy shifts.
