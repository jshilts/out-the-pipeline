# Two For One Sale (February 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article criticizes two common practices in biomedical literature, both exemplified by a PNAS paper on a broad-spectrum antiviral compound named LJ001. The first complaint is that biology papers often fail to disclose the chemical structure of compounds they describe, frustrating chemists who want to understand the molecular basis of reported effects. The LJ001 paper forces readers to dig through supplemental materials to page 10 to find the compound's structure.

The second complaint is that LJ001 turns out to be a rhodanine derivative - a chemical class that medicinal chemists view with extreme skepticism due to poor track records in drug development. The author notes that modifying the problematic thioamide group (the feature chemists dislike most about rhodanines) to a regular amide, converting it to a thiazolidinedione (TZD), eliminates all antiviral activity, suggesting the very structural features that make rhodanines problematic may be essential for the observed biological effects.

## 2. HISTORY

The LJ001 antiviral compound discussed in the 2010 article appears to have had limited subsequent development success. A search of the scientific literature and regulatory databases reveals no FDA-approved drugs derived from LJ001 or its rhodanine-based analogues for broad-spectrum antiviral applications in the years following the original PNAS publication.

The broader concern about rhodanine chemical scaffolds in drug discovery has been validated by subsequent research. Multiple studies in the 2010s confirmed that rhodanines are "frequent hitters" and pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS) that show promiscuous activity across many assay types, often through non-specific mechanisms rather than true target engagement. The community's skepticism about rhodanines has persisted, with these compounds largely avoided in legitimate drug discovery programs.

The article's implicit prediction that the LJ001 discovery would not lead to viable therapeutics appears to have been accurate. No major pharmaceutical company successfully developed rhodanine-based broad-spectrum antivirals in the subsequent decade, and the field has moved toward other chemical scaffolds and mechanisms for antiviral drug discovery.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contains no explicit forward-looking predictions, but it makes strong implicit predictions about drug development feasibility:

• **Implicit Prediction**: That rhodanine-based compounds like LJ001 would face major obstacles in drug development due to their problematic chemical nature.
• **Outcome**: ✓ **Accurate**. The drug development community's skepticism toward rhodanines proved well-founded, and no successful rhodanine-based broad-spectrum antivirals emerged from this line of research.

• **Implicit Prediction**: That the specific structural features of rhodanines responsible for their biological activity (such as the thioamide group mentioned) would be inseparable from the problematic chemical properties that make them undesirable drug candidates.  
• **Outcome**: ✓ **Accurate**. The observation that removing the problematic thioamide group eliminated activity suggested that any medicinal chemistry optimization would face difficult trade-offs between activity and drug-like properties.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article addresses an important but specialized issue in drug discovery - the gap between biological activity and chemical drug-likeness - but has limited general importance. While the specific LJ001 example and broader rhodanine discussion illustrate genuine problems in medicinal chemistry practice, the topic is primarily of interest to specialists in the field.
