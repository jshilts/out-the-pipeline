# An Economist Who Gets It (December 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article praises economist Alex Tabarrok's analysis of "me-too drugs" - follow-on pharmaceuticals that are chemically similar to pioneering medications. Tabarrok argues against critics like Marcia Angell who dismiss these drugs as wasteful duplications with minimal clinical value. His key arguments include: (1) individual patient response varies significantly, making multiple similar drugs clinically useful since different patients respond better to different variants; (2) small improvements like once-daily versus twice-daily dosing significantly impact real-world effectiveness by improving patient adherence; and (3) the economic principle that drugs people actually take are better than those they don't, regardless of chemical novelty.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent two decades strongly validated Tabarrok's economic framework for pharmaceutical innovation. The "me-too drug" debate evolved significantly:

- **Clinical Validation of Variability**: Precision medicine emerged as a major paradigm, confirming that genetic and physiological differences make individual responses to similar drugs meaningfully different. Pharmacogenomics became standard practice for many drug classes.
  
- **Regulatory Evolution**: The FDA developed more sophisticated approval pathways recognizing incremental improvements (505(b)(2) applications), while payers implemented formularies that explicitly consider adherence and real-world effectiveness alongside efficacy.

- **Patient Adherence Evidence**: Extensive health economics research confirmed that dosing frequency directly correlates with adherence rates. Once-daily medications typically show 70-80% adherence versus 50-60% for multiple daily doses, translating to measurable clinical and economic benefits.

- **Business Outcomes**: Pharmaceutical companies continued developing follow-on drugs, with notable successes in drug classes like statins (atorvastatin following simvastatin), proton pump inhibitors, and antidepressants. Patent strategies evolved to protect incremental innovations while generics later captured substantial market share.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: "Me-too drugs can have different effects in different people" - that individual variation justifies multiple similar drugs
  **Outcome**: **Confirmed with strong evidence**. Precision medicine and pharmacogenomics validated substantial inter-individual variation. Tests like CYP450 genotyping now guide drug selection, and patient-specific responses are recognized as central to drug effectiveness.

• **Prediction**: Once-daily dosing represents meaningful clinical improvement over twice-daily regimens through better adherence
  **Outcome**: **Strongly confirmed**. Meta-analyses consistently show once-daily dosing improves adherence by 15-25 percentage points across therapeutic areas. This translates to reduced hospitalizations, better disease control, and lower healthcare costs.

• **Prediction**: Economic value lies in drugs people actually take, not just chemical novelty
  **Outcome**: **Fundamentally validated**. Health economics now routinely incorporates adherence, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and real-world evidence into drug valuation. Pay-for-performance models and outcomes-based contracting reflect this understanding.

• **Broader Implication**: Competition among similar drugs drives beneficial innovation
  **Outcome**: **Mixed but generally positive**. While some "me-too" drugs offered minimal innovation, the competitive dynamic drove genuine improvements (better side effect profiles, novel delivery mechanisms, extended-release formulations). Healthcare systems developed tools to distinguish meaningful from marginal innovations.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article identified fundamental economic principles underlying pharmaceutical innovation that became increasingly important as healthcare systems grappled with drug costs and real-world effectiveness. Tabarrok's insights anticipated the broader shift toward value-based healthcare and patient-centered outcomes that defined pharmaceutical policy debates in subsequent decades.
