# Thoughts on Overpublishing (February 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article reflects on the publication pattern of chemist Alan Katritzky, who authored approximately 2,215 papers over 61 years—roughly one paper every ten days. The author poses the question of whether such high-volume publishing benefits science or creates problems, contrasting Katritzky with historical figures like Isaac Newton and Lars Onsager who were reluctant publishers. The author acknowledges both extremes are problematic: excessive publication makes it difficult for the field to identify the truly valuable contributions, while under-publishing can prevent others from building on important work or lead to redundant effort. The piece raises concerns about quality control and whether the scientific community has effective mechanisms to distinguish signal from noise when faced with massive publication volumes.

## 2. HISTORY
Subsequent developments in the years following this 2014 article have highlighted that overpublication concerns were prescient and have only intensified:

**Publication Volume Explosion**: Scientific publishing has continued its dramatic growth. By 2020, researchers were publishing over 5 million scientific papers annually, up from approximately 2.5 million in 2014. This acceleration has been particularly pronounced in biomedical fields.

**Quality Concerns and Replication Crisis**: The period after 2014 saw heightened awareness of reproducibility issues across multiple scientific disciplines. High-profile cases of retractions, data manipulation, and irreproducible results drew attention to systemic problems in scientific publishing. Studies suggested that a significant portion of published research—estimates range from 20-50% depending on the field—cannot be reliably reproduced.

**Predatory Publishing Growth**: The number of predatory journals exploded after 2014, with estimates of over 8,000 such journals by 2017 publishing hundreds of thousands of papers with little to no peer review. This has added substantial noise to the scientific literature.

**Citation Patterns**: Research into citation metrics post-2014 has shown that most papers receive few citations, with a long tail of rarely-cited work. However, Katritzky's approach may have been rational in his specific context (heterocyclic chemistry methodology), where multiple small incremental papers documenting reagent behavior served a genuine community need for reference data.

**Policy Responses**: Many academic institutions and funding agencies began implementing policies to emphasize quality over quantity in hiring, promotion, and grant decisions. The Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), signed by increasing numbers of institutions after 2014, specifically addresses concerns about over-reliance on publication metrics.

No specific biotech drugs or companies were discussed in the original article, so no direct impact on pharmaceutical outcomes can be assessed.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not make explicit predictions about future developments, though it raised an implicit concern that the trend toward high-volume publishing would continue posing quality control challenges for the scientific community. Subsequent developments have largely validated these concerns, with the volume of scientific publications increasing substantially and the scientific community grappling with reproducibility issues and the challenge of distinguishing high-quality work in an increasingly crowded landscape.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

The article addresses a persistent and increasingly relevant problem in scientific publishing, and its themes have become even more salient in the decade since publication. However, it primarily raises rather than resolves questions, and focuses on individual cases rather than systematic analysis of the phenomenon.
