# Because I Never Lie, and I'm Always Right (February 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is a reflective commentary on scientific hubris, framed around the author's memory of an undergraduate physics lab partner who dismissed the lab manual's instructions with "That can't be right" and repositioned lenses based on his own intuition, only to fail and ultimately follow the manual. The author analyzes why this attitude bothered him: not the skepticism toward authority, but the partner's excessive self-trust—an undergraduate challenging results known for three hundred years without first testing the manual's approach. The piece then extends this insight to the author's own career in science, acknowledging that even with 16+ years of experience, he must guard against overconfidence when advising younger colleagues, as experience-based assumptions, while often correct, can still be wrong.

## 2. HISTORY

This article was published on Derek Lowe's long-running blog "In the Pipeline," which chronicles drug discovery and the biotechnology industry. Lowe, a medicinal chemist, has maintained this blog since 2002, offering candid, expert commentary on scientific research, clinical trials, pharmaceutical companies, and industry trends. In the years following February 2006, "In the Pipeline" grew into one of the most widely read and respected science blogs, known for its accessible explanations of complex science and its critical, evidence-based perspective, directly embodying the intellectual humility and wariness of overconfidence highlighted in this piece. This particular article has been frequently cited and remembered by readers for its memorable, quotable lesson about scientific hubris. The pharmaceutical and biotech landscape itself, however, continued on its established trajectory of high R&D costs, frequent clinical failures, occasional breakthrough approvals, and ongoing challenges in drug discovery.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contains no explicit predictions about future events, technological developments, or business outcomes in the biotechnology industry. It is a reflective essay on a principle of scientific conduct—intellectual humility—rather than a forward-looking analysis.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**
Reasoning for the rating: The article's core message about intellectual humility and avoiding overconfidence is a timeless and valuable principle in science, presented through a memorable anecdote. However, it does not analyze or predict specific developments in the biotechnology industry, making it a piece on scientific mindset rather than a commentary with concrete historical or business implications for the field.
