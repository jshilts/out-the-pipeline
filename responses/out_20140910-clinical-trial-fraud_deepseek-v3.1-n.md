# Clinical Trial Fraud (September 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

In September 2014, Evotec AG announced that Hyperion Therapeutics was terminating development of DiaPep277, a therapeutic candidate for newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetes. Hyperion had recently acquired Andromeda Biotech in June 2014, but during due diligence discovered that certain Andromeda employees had engaged in serious misconduct involving clinical trial data manipulation. The fraud involved collusion with a third-party biostatistics firm in Israel to improperly access unblinded data from the DIA-AID 1 Phase 3 trial and manipulate analyses to produce favorable results, with evidence suggesting this practice continued into the ongoing DIA-AID 2 trial. Hyperion suspended the implicated employees, notified regulatory authorities, and decided to complete the DIA-AID 2 trial but terminate further DiaPep277 development.

## 2. HISTORY

The DiaPep277 clinical trial fraud scandal represents one of the most significant cases of data manipulation in diabetes drug development. After Hyperion's disclosure in September 2014, regulatory investigations followed, though specific sanctions and legal outcomes have not been widely publicized in accessible records.

**Clinical Development Impact**: The termination effectively ended DiaPep277's development pathway despite earlier promising Phase 2 results. No subsequent successful Phase 3 trials or FDA approval occurred for this peptide therapy targeting heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) as an immunomodulator in Type 1 diabetes.

**Company Outcomes**: Hyperion's acquisition of Andromeda became a cautionary tale about acquisition due diligence. Hyperion itself was later acquired by Horizon Pharma (now Horizon Therapeutics) in 2015, which subsequently became part of Amgen in 2023. The fraud discovery likely influenced acquisition terms and due diligence practices industry-wide.

**Regulatory and Industry Impact**: This case contributed to increased scrutiny of clinical trial data integrity and biostatistical practices. The incident occurred during a period when regulatory agencies were strengthening Good Clinical Practice (GCP) oversight, though concrete policy changes specifically tied to this case are not clearly documented in public records.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Immediate Clinical Consequences**: The article correctly anticipated that Hyperion would face significant challenges, though the direct termination of development rather than attempts to salvage the program suggests the fraud was more extensive than initial reports indicated.

• **Regulatory Action**: The piece accurately predicted that regulatory authorities would be notified and investigations would follow, though the author couldn't have known the specific outcomes or enforcement actions that resulted.

• **Industry Implications**: The article's concern about overall data vulnerability anticipated broader industry impacts on clinical trial oversight, though concrete systemic changes would require regulatory leadership rather than isolated company responses.

• **DiaPep277's Future**: The drug never achieved FDA approval or market entry, validating the termination decision made in response to the fraud discovery.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This case represents an important real-world example of clinical trial fraud with significant consequences, though it occurred in a specific therapeutic area without broad industry-transforming impact compared to larger data integrity scandals.
