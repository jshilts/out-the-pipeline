# How Much Action Should the FDA Take? (January 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary examines the tension between the FDA's regulatory mandate (safety and efficacy) and growing public pressure for the agency to address rising generic drug prices. The article was written in response to dramatic price increases for older medications like Daraprim (pyrimethamine), colchicine, and Makena—drugs that had been on the market for years but saw costs soar after companies obtained FDA approval through programs designed to modernize regulation of older compounds.

The author highlights compounding pharmacies as a potential market-based solution, citing examples where compounders could provide cheaper alternatives when single manufacturers dramatically raised prices. The core dilemma is that while the public wants both lower drug prices and FDA approval decisions based solely on safety and efficacy, these goals can conflict in practice. The article notes that giving FDA an explicit role in pricing decisions could undermine public trust in the agency's scientific integrity and open the door to political pressure that prioritizes economic concerns over individual patient needs. The author references the 2011 Avastin controversy as evidence that any FDA decision perceived as limiting access is immediately viewed as "health care rationing," regardless of scientific justification.

## 2. HISTORY

The period following this article saw significant developments in drug pricing policy and FDA regulatory approach:

**Compounding Pharmacy Regulation:** The FDA continued to strengthen oversight of compounding pharmacies following the 2012 fungal meningitis outbreak linked to the New England Compounding Center. The agency increased inspections and enforcement actions, making it clear that compounders could not mass-produce drugs that competed with FDA-approved products without meeting manufacturing standards. This constrained the ability of compounders to serve as market competitors to price-gouged drugs.

**Daraprim Saga:** Turing Pharmaceuticals, led by Martin Shkreli, raised Daraprim's price from $13.50 to $750 per pill in 2015. While compounders initially provided alternatives, FDA scrutiny and manufacturing challenges limited widespread compounding. The drug eventually faced competition from FDA-approved generics: in 2023, Cerovene received approval for pyrimethamine tablets, creating legitimate market competition. However, this resolution took nearly eight years.

**Generic Drug Competition:** The FDA accelerated generic drug approvals under Commissioner Scott Gottlieb (2017-2019) through the Drug Competition Action Plan. The agency prioritized review of generics for drugs with limited competition, including drugs that had seen dramatic price increases. This approach allowed the FDA to address pricing indirectly through market competition rather than direct price regulation.

**FDA Authority Expansion:** The agency maintained its position that it lacks statutory authority to regulate drug prices. However, the 21st Century Cures Act (2016) and subsequent FDA guidance documents emphasized the importance of drug competition and transparency while preserving the agency's focus on safety and efficacy.

**Policy Realignment:** The federal government addressed drug pricing through other mechanisms—the Inflation Reduction Act (2022) gave Medicare limited authority to negotiate drug prices, a power that remained separate from FDA approval considerations. This institutional separation preserved FDA's scientific independence while creating alternative pathways for price regulation.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article included several implicit predictions and concerns:

• **Prediction that giving FDA a pricing role would undermine public trust** - **ACCURATE:** The FDA maintained its science-focused mandate without direct pricing authority. While political pressure on drug prices increased dramatically, the agency successfully preserved its reputation for decisions based on medical evidence. Medicare price negotiation was assigned to CMS, not FDA, preserving institutional boundaries.

• **Concern that Congress would pressure FDA for cost-based decisions** - **PARTIALLY ACCURATE:** While Congress indeed enacted major drug pricing legislation (Inflation Reduction Act), the FDA itself was not given price-regulating authority. The separation of price negotiation from approval decisions validated the article's concern about maintaining FDA's scientific integrity.

• **Implicit prediction that compounding would remain a limited solution** - **ACCURATE:** Compounding pharmacies faced increased FDA regulation following the 2012 meningitis outbreak. Stricter oversight and manufacturing requirements significantly limited the ability of compounders to compete with manufactured drugs, making them a sporadic rather than systematic solution to price increases.

• **Concern about "health care rationing" accusations** - **ACCURATE BUT MODERATED:** While critics continued to accuse the FDA of rationing (particularly evident during COVID-19 vaccine approval debates), the agency's consistently science-based approach to approvals built sufficient credibility that such accusations became less potent politically.

• **Implicit expectation that price increases would continue without institutional change** - **ACCURATE:** Drug prices continued to rise, leading to the Inflation Reduction Act's Medicare negotiation provisions. However, the FDA's role remained unchanged—validating the article's argument that meaningful price control required legislative action rather than FDA mission expansion.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article identified a fundamental tension in drug regulation that became increasingly relevant as drug pricing dominated policy debates. It correctly predicted the FDA would maintain its science-focused mandate while external institutions developed alternative pricing mechanisms, demonstrating sophisticated understanding of regulatory boundaries.
