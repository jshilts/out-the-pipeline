# RNA Takes Over (December 2021)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses the expanding understanding of RNA's diversity and cellular importance beyond traditional messenger RNA, transfer RNA, and ribosomal RNA. The author highlights emerging categories like short hairpin RNA, double-stranded RNA, long noncoding RNA, circular RNA, and microRNA, emphasizing that many RNA functions remain poorly understood.

The central argument revolves around RNA's underestimated prevalence in cells, challenging protein-centric views of cellular composition, which the author suggests might better be described as a "bag of RNA." The article connects this to biomolecular condensates—phase-separated cellular droplets—frequently associated with RNA species, often forming "complex coacervates" through interactions between positively charged proteins and negatively charged RNA.

The author hypothesizes about evolutionary pressures on cellular properties to optimize condensate formation, emphasizing phosphate groups' crucial role in biochemistry and their abundance in cellular components (ATP, inositol phosphates, oligonucleotides, proteins, and phospholipids). This suggests RNA species as integral to these fundamental cellular processes.

## 2. HISTORY

The period following this article's publication proved significantly impactful for RNA-based biology and medicine, though not primarily through the mechanisms emphasized in the text.

Most notably, mRNA vaccines had already gained prominence by December 2021, having received their first emergency use authorizations a year prior. The two primary COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech's BNT162b2 and Moderna's mRNA-1273) demonstrated approximately 95% efficacy in initial clinical trials and subsequently received full FDA approval. These vaccines achieved widespread global deployment, with billions of doses administered by 2022, representing one of the largest public health interventions in history.

On the therapeutics front, the post-2021 period saw the approval of multiple small interfering RNA (siRNA) medicines, mostly for rare diseases. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals continued its success with Onpattro (patisiran) and expanded approvals for other RNA interference drugs. However, clinical failures also occurred, including the discontinuation of several RNA-based candidates.

The biomolecular condensates concept, prominently featured in the article, did not lead to FDA-approved drugs by 2025, nor did it revolutionize drug design approaches as initially hoped. While research continued—particularly focused on neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and inflammation—significant controversy emerged regarding interpretation issues, methodological artifacts, and whether condensates represent therapeutic targets or cellular epiphenomena. Some high-profile condensate biology papers faced scrutiny, calls for rigor standards increased, and enthusiasm became somewhat tempered by empirical constraints.

Alternative RNA modalities like antisense oligonucleotides, mRNA therapeutics beyond vaccines, and RNA-based gene therapies saw continued development, though with mixed clinical success and narrower disease targets than initially projected.

The author's "bag of RNA" conceptual framework did not fundamentally shift pharmaceutical or biological thinking; protein-centric drug development remained dominant, though RNA gained recognition as a viable therapeutic modality rather than primarily an intracellular structural component.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions about future developments; here's how they compared to subsequent reality:

**Prediction: RNA's cellular importance would become increasingly recognized, moving beyond protein-centric thinking**
- **Reality**: Mixed. While RNA-based therapeutics gained prominence, clinical success came primarily through direct therapeutic applications (vaccines, siRNA drugs) rather than through recognition of RNA's general cellular dominance. Protein-centric drug development remained dominant.

**Prediction: Biomolecular condensates would drive discoveries about cellular organization and potentially therapeutics**
- **Reality**: Somewhat accurate for fundamental biology, largely unfulfilled for medicine. Condensate research continued but didn't yield drug approvals. By 2024-2025, the field faced increased scrutiny over reproducibility concerns, interpretation challenges, and questions about clinical relevance.

**Prediction: Diverse RNA species would prove functionally important over simple messenger/coding roles**
- **Reality**: Partially correct. Non-coding RNAs did demonstrate functional significance in research contexts, but therapeutic development focused primarily on delivering or inhibiting specific RNA sequences rather than leveraging complex cellular RNA networks for drug design.

**Prediction: Understanding cellular phase separation would illuminate health and disease mechanisms**
- **Reality**: Limited validation. While condensate biology provided insights into some disease mechanisms (particularly neurodegenerative conditions like ALS and Alzheimer's), it did not broadly transform disease understanding or yield breakthrough therapies by 2025.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

The article captured RNA's expanding biological significance at an important historical moment, presaging therapeutic advances that followed. However, its emphasis on condensate biology—while scientifically interesting—did not match the trajectory of RNA's clinical success, which came primarily through straightforward delivery of therapeutic RNA molecules rather than through the sophisticated cellular organizational roles described in the text.
