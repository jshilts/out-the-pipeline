# Fluorine NMR: Why Not? (February 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2012 blog post discusses the underutilization of fluorine-19 NMR spectroscopy in chemistry, particularly in drug discovery. The author highlights a recent Amgen paper demonstrating 19F NMR as a fragment-based screening tool. The technique allows screening of mixtures containing 10-12 fluorinated compounds simultaneously against protein targets by observing fluorine peak broadening upon binding. Key advantages include not requiring deuterated solvents, working with native proteins, and the ability to measure binding constants. The post also mentions the potential for studying intra-ligand NOE effects and fragment linking—connecting separate binding fragments to create more potent compounds—while noting that earlier SAR-by-NMR approaches never really succeeded commercially.

## 2. HISTORY

After 2012, 19F NMR did not revolutionize drug discovery as hoped, but it established a solid niche in fragment-based screening and mechanistic studies:

- **Adoption in Industry**: Major pharmaceutical companies (Pfizer, Novartis, AstraZeneca) integrated 19F NMR into fragment screening platforms, though primarily as a complementary tool rather than a standalone solution. It became particularly valuable for proteins that are difficult to crystallize.
- **Clinical Impact**: The most notable success story is **venetoclax** (Venclexta), a BCL-2 inhibitor approved by the FDA in 2016 for certain leukemias. Fragment screening using NMR (including 19F methods) played a role in the discovery pathway.
- **Technical Improvements**: Sensitivity enhancements through cryoprobes and higher field magnets made 19F NMR more practical. Research groups developed sophisticated 19F-based methods for studying protein dynamics and conformational changes.
- **Limitations Confirmed**: 19F NMR remained limited by the requirement for fluorinated compounds and the relative scarcity of fluorine in drugs (only ~20% of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, limiting its universal applicability).
- **Academic Growth**: Publications involving 19F NMR increased steadily but not dramatically, indicating method adoption rather than revolutionary impact.

The technique found its place as a valuable but not transformative tool in the medicinal chemistry toolbox.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction**: "perhaps it'll lead a few more people to think of things that could be done with fluorine NMR" → **Outcome**: ✓ **Partially accurate** – 19F NMR gained modest traction in fragment screening but never became a mainstream primary screening tool. Academic and industrial adoption increased gradually.

- **Prediction**: Fragment linking might benefit from 19F intra-ligand NOE methods → **Outcome**: ✗ **Mostly failed** – Fragment linking remained challenging and rarely led to approved drugs. 19F NMR provided additional data but didn't solve the fundamental challenges of fragment-based drug design.

- **Prediction**: (Implicit) That easy experimental setup would drive widespread adoption → **Outcome**: ✗ **Failed** – Despite advantages (no deuterated solvents needed, native proteins), 19F NMR adoption was limited by the need for fluorinated libraries and competing techniques like surface plasmon resonance and thermal shift assays.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 4/10**

The 2012 article highlighted a potentially useful but ultimately niche technique. 19F NMR found practical applications in fragment screening but did not revolutionize drug discovery as hoped. The underlying scientific question remains moderately interesting, but its real-world impact has been modest compared to other advances in the field.

## 5. CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT

High confidence: Technical details about 19F NMR capabilities and the Amgen paper are well-documented. Venetoclax's discovery pathway and FDA approval are publicly confirmed. Pharmaceutical industry adoption patterns are supported by published literature and conference proceedings from 2012-2020.
