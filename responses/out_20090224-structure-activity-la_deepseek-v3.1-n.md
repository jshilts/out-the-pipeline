# Structure-Activity: Lather, Rinse, and Repeat (February 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2009 commentary from a medicinal chemist reflects on the messy reality of structure-activity relationship (SAR) exploration in drug discovery. The author describes how actual SAR data rarely follows textbook-perfect additive patterns, noting common surprises such as "boundary conditions" where small changes kill activity, conditional SAR rules that contradict each other, and "Only Thing That Works" positions where only one specific substituent is tolerated.

The article emphasizes that proteins are flexible and can adopt multiple binding modes in response to ligand modifications, making prediction difficult. The author observed that SAR dogmas become entrenched in drug programs, sometimes preventing chemists from discovering hidden opportunities. The piece captures the practical challenges of medicinal chemistry in an era before widespread computational modeling and structure-based design.

## 2. HISTORY

In the period following this 2009 article, several developments transformed how medicinal chemists approach SAR:

**Crystallography and Structural Biology**: Between 2010-2020, advancements in protein crystallography, cryo-EM, and NMR provided more high-resolution protein-ligand complex structures. This helped explain some of the non-additive SAR patterns the author described, particularly those involving protein flexibility and binding mode changes. By 2020, many drug discovery programs routinely used structure-based design.

**Computational Approaches**: Physics-based modeling methods (free energy perturbation, molecular dynamics) and machine learning approaches gained traction throughout the 2010s. Fragment-based drug discovery became more established, helping identify unexpected binding interactions.

**DNA-Encoded Libraries (DEL)**: By the mid-2010s, DEL technology enabled screening of billions of compounds, revealing SAR patterns at scale that would be impossible to explore manually. This led to better statistical understanding of substituent effects.

**PROTACs and Molecular Glues**: The late 2010s saw the emergence of heterobifunctional molecules (PROTACs), which added new complexity to SAR—requiring optimization of two binding events plus linker geometry.

Despite these advances, the fundamental challenges the author described persist. Unexpected SAR discontinuities still derail drug programs, and many targets remain "undruggable" due to difficult SAR landscapes. However, the tools available to understand and navigate these challenges have improved substantially.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **"Medicinal chemistry is not going away anytime soon"** ✓ **Accurate**: Medicinal chemistry remains central to drug discovery. While computer-aided design has grown, human expertise in understanding SAR complexity is still essential.

- **"We can't predict their responses, at least not yet and not very well"** ✓ **Partially addressed but ongoing**: By 2020-2024, computational prediction has improved but still struggles with protein flexibility, binding site water displacement, and entropic effects. AlphaFold2 (2020) helped with protein structure prediction, but ligand binding prediction remains challenging.

- **Implicit prediction about SAR complexity persisting**: ✓ **Accurate**: Modern drug discovery (covalent inhibitors, allosteric modulators, PROTACs) has introduced even more complex SAR patterns than described in 2009.

- **"Perfectly Additive SAR... taking place in a fairly narrow structure space"** ✓ **Accurate**: Fragment-based approaches have shown that additive SAR can work in limited contexts, but broad applicability remains elusive in most programs.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article captures enduring truths about medicinal chemistry practice with authenticity that remains relevant today. While some technical details have evolved with new technologies, the fundamental challenges of SAR interpretation persist across nearly all drug discovery programs, making this historically insightful for understanding the practical constraints that shaped drug development both in 2009 and today.
