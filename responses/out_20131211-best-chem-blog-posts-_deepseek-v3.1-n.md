# Best Chem-Blog Posts of 2013 (December 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This is a brief announcement post by Derek Lowe on his "In the Pipeline" blog at Science.org. In December 2013, Lowe shared that his blog had been included in Nature's "Sceptical Chymist" roundup of the top chemistry blog posts of 2013. He provided a link to the Nature blog post and noted that while he made their list, many other quality posts were also recognized.

## 2. HISTORY
After this post was published:
- Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog continued to grow in influence and readership throughout the 2010s, becoming one of the most widely read chemistry and drug discovery blogs in the industry
- The blog maintained its editorial independence (as noted in his disclaimer) while Lowe worked at various pharmaceutical companies
- In 2019, Lowe left Science.org and moved his blog to a new platform, continuing his commentary on drug discovery and pharmaceutical industry developments
- The blog format remained popular, with Lowe consistently publishing several posts per week covering clinical trial results, industry news, medicinal chemistry topics, and safety issues
- The specific "Things I Won't Work With" series mentioned in the sidebar became particularly popular for its entertaining coverage of dangerous chemicals
- The blog continued to be cited and referenced by chemists, drug discovery researchers, and industry professionals

## 3. PREDICTIONS
This particular post contained no explicit predictions about future developments. It was purely a self-referential announcement about blog recognition.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 2**

This is fundamentally a meta-announcement about blog rankings rather than substantive commentary on biotechnology or pharmaceutical developments. While the context (Lowe's influential blog) is notable within chemistry and drug discovery communities, the post itself has minimal long-term importance or broader industry relevance.
