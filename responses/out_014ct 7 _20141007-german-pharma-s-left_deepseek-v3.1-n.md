# After-the-Fact Analysis: “German Pharma, Or What’s Left of It” (Science Magazine, 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reflects on the decline of the German pharmaceutical industry, citing mergers (Bayer and Schering), sell-offs (Hoechst and BASF’s pharma units), and the diminished R&D standing of remaining players like Boehringer Ingelheim and Merck (Darmstadt). The piece points to strategic “Wankelmut” (vacillation) over the relationship between industrial chemicals and pharma divisions—Bayer long resisted analyst pressure to break up, while peers divested pharma units abroad rather than spinning them out independently. A key observation is the lack of a dynamic biotech startup sector to backstop incumbents, in contrast to the U.S. where science-led disruption produced giants like Amgen, Biogen, and Genentech. The author raises—but does not resolve—the question of whether German aversion to disruption is cause or symptom, noting that Swiss pharma (e.g., Novartis and Roche) thrived without wild swings.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments broadly validated the article’s diagnosis and revealed even deeper strategic drift.

- **Bayer**: In 2018, Bayer acquired Monsanto for ~$63 billion, transforming into a life sciences/agriculture conglomerate and taking on massive litigation risk over glyphosate. The company did not fully break up, but in 2024 it announced a plan to separate into three independent units—potentially enabling pharma to operate with greater focus. R&D productivity in pharma has been mixed; blockbusters like the anticoagulant Xarelto helped, but pipeline gaps persist, while debt from the Monsanto deal constrained investment flexibility.
  - **Gene therapies and biotech partnerships**: Bayer built late-stage gene therapy programs via acquisitions (e.g., Dimension Therapeutics, then Asklepios/AskBio), attempting to catch up in a field the article notes Germany missed at the startup stage.

- **Merck KGaA (Darmstadt)**: In 2015 it acquired Sigma-Aldrich, reinforcing its life science tools and chemicals position over pharma. The company’s pharma R&D has not produced sustained first-in-class breakthroughs; its PD-L1 inhibitor Bavencio is an also-ran vs. Roche/Merck & Co. oncology leaders.

- **Boehringer Ingelheim**: Remained family-owned and generally focused, with respectable respiratory (e.g., Ofev for IPF) and diabetes portfolios, but it did not “join the top ranks” and maintained a more regional footprint than global peers. They cultivated external innovation via early-stage partnering and venture-style activities (e.g., the Apeiron Biologics spin-in for COVID-19 assets).

- **M&A and divestitures**: Novartis divested its Alcon eye-care unit and later spun off Sandoz (generics), refocusing on innovative pharma, while Roche leaned into diagnostics and biotech-driven immunology/oncology. German firms, in contrast, largely avoided disruptive portfolio surgery until later, if at all, confirming the “Wankelmut” charge. E.g., Stada, a German generics firm, went private via private equity and expanded, but it did not challenge the innovative pharma leaders.

- **German biotech startup ecosystem**: Germany eventually developed a small but meaningful biotech scene—BioNTech’s oncology work and, pivotally, its COVID-19 mRNA vaccine collaboration with Pfizer—delivered a landmark success, albeit one forged amid a pandemic and with a U.S. partner. However, this remained an outlier; Germany did not produce a durable biotech cluster comparable to U.S. hubs.

- **Industry positioning**: The gap between, say, Roche/Novartis and Germán majors widened in oncology and immunology. German firms underinvested in high-risk platforms (gene therapy, RNA, cell therapy) and biologics, often holding onto small-molecule heritage too long.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Correct**:
  - Diagnosing strategic vacillation (“Wankelmut”) as a structural brake: Bayer’s later multi-billion-dollar diversification into agriculture before returning toward a pharma-centered three-way split plan illustrates the pattern. Other German players likewise stayed conservative in pharma R&D while U.S. peers built large-molecule and platform pipelines.
  - Lack of a disruptive biotech underlayer: Despite BioNTech’s emergence, Germany has not generated a sustainable cohort of startup-originated global leaders (no German Amgen or Genentech). Many German innovators out-license or seek U.S. partnership/IPOs rather than scaling in-country.
  - The relative ranking slip: Bayer and Merck KGaA have not closed the gap with top-tier innovators and now compete in select niches rather than at the therapeutic frontier overall.

- **Partially right / nuanced**:
  - The role of industrial conglomerate structures: Bayer’s later partial breakup aligns with analyst “breakup” pressure; Merck KGaA’s pivot to life science tools avoided the pure pharma race. The article frames the conglomerate drag, but the pathway varied—Bayer stayed combined longer, Merck emphasized non-pharma, and Boehringer remained private and stable—suggesting symptoms of a deeper issue (risk aversion, capital allocation, legacy culture).
  - Swiss pharma as counterexample: Roche and Novartis did maintain strong innovation engines (e.g., Roche’s antibody engineering; Novartis’s CAR-T and gene therapy platforms like AveXis/Zolgensma). The article’s question was apt: the contrast highlights that stability and focus can coexist with cutting-edge R&D where institutional strategy and governance align.

- **Incorrect or less clear-cut**:
  - The article implies relatively linear decline; instead, German firms made selective late-stage platform acquisitions or partnerships (e.g., Bayer–AskBio, BioNTech mRNA) that recovered some ground. BioNTech proved a major-footnote exception to Germany’s startup deficit.
  - The “US-style turmoil” argument is incomplete: Aversion to “disruption” appears symptomatic of governance cultures and capital markets rather than purely a business-strategy choice. Germany’s domestic market lacks the deep crossover venture capital, activist investor pressure, and M&A-driven restructurings typical in the U.S., which can force R&D focus.

## 4. INTEREST

**Decile score: 6** (60–69th percentile; moderately to fairly high interest)

This article has held up well as a trenchant and accurate critique of German pharma’s lost decade and its structural causes. It correctly identified deep-seated governance and strategy problems and pointed to the absence of a vibrant startup ecosystem long before COVID-19 briefly spotlighted a German biotech success. The piece is not at the very top of the interest scale (7–9) because the predicted trajectory was largely confirmed without major surprise; the outcomes were extensions of existing trends. However, its core insight—linking industry decline to risk culture and market structure—remains relevant to national innovation policy debates in Europe and beyond, making it more than a simple historical snapshot.
