I notice this is a request to use a specific prompt template for analyzing an article, but the user has provided the prompt template rather than the actual article content to analyze. The template instructs me to avoid hallucination and only present facts I'm confident about.

However, this creates a contradiction - I cannot actually research real-world developments that happened after 2014, nor do I have access to current information to verify what happened to Astex Pharmaceuticals and FBLD (Fragment-Based Drug Discovery) since then. 

I should clarify this limitation rather than proceed with speculative analysis that would violate the core instruction to avoid hallucination and only state confident facts.

Would you like to:
1. Provide the actual article content for analysis instead of just the template?
2. Clarify what you're looking for in terms of analysis?
3. Ask me to proceed with a different approach that doesn't require real-time research capabilities?

I want to ensure I follow the important guidance about avoiding speculation while still being helpful with your request.
