# Thiola, Retrophin, Martin Shkreli, Reddit, and More (September 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This blog post recounts the immediate aftermath of the author's previous article exposing Retrophin's massive price increase for Thiola (tiopronin), a generic drug used to treat cystinuria. After the story went viral on Reddit and reached the front page, Martin Shkreli—then CEO of Retrophin—unexpectedly appeared in the Reddit thread for an impromptu AMA, even sharing his personal contact information. Subsequently, the entire Reddit thread disappeared from r/News and the author was temporarily banned from the subreddit, though later reinstated.

The article analyzes Shkreli's defense of the Thiola price hike. His main arguments were that: (1) patients wouldn't pay the increased price directly—insurance companies would; (2) Retrophin would develop new formulations that previous manufacturer Mission Pharmacal had neglected; (3) the previous company had supply issues and was reluctant to raise prices despite the drug being undervalued; and (4) Retrophin was dedicated to rare disease patients.

The author dissects Retrophin's strategy as revealed in company investor presentations: planned introduction of new dosages (250mg, 500mg) followed by discontinuation of the 100mg formulation, then later a time-release version would replace those dosages—a pattern that would make it difficult for generic competitors to demonstrate bioequivalence and enter the market. The author characterizes this as "regulatory rent-seeking" rather than innovation-driven pricing, arguing that while patent-based monopolies reward invention for a limited time, Retrophin was using regulatory loopholes to maintain indefinite monopoly pricing power over an off-patent drug.

## 2. HISTORY

**Martin Shkreli's trajectory after 2014:** This 2014 article captured Shkreli at the beginning of his notorious career in pharmaceutical price manipulation. In 2015, he gained far greater notoriety when his new company Turing Pharmaceuticals acquired Daraprim and raised its price from $13.50 to $750 per pill—a 5,000% increase. This sparked national outrage and congressional hearings. By December 2015, Shkreli was arrested on securities fraud charges related to his time at Retrophin. In 2017, he was convicted on three counts of securities fraud and conspiracy, and sentenced to seven years in prison. He was released in 2022 but remains a controversial figure.

**Retrophin after Shkreli:** Retrophin fired Shkreli in 2014 and later sued him, eventually reaching a $40 million settlement for damages. The company shifted its business model away from Shkreli's controversial strategies and focused on developing treatments for rare diseases, including its lead drug Sparsentan. Retrophin was acquired by Travere Therapeutics in 2020.

**Thiola and tiopronin:** Thiola (tiopronin) continued to be an important treatment for cystinuria. The FDA approved generic versions of tiopronin, introducing competition that should have moderated prices. However, the broader issue of generic drug price increases, particularly for older drugs with limited competition, became a major policy concern throughout the 2010s. The strategy Shkreli pioneered—acquiring older generics and implementing massive price increases—was replicated by other companies, leading to the "gray market" problem in generic drugs where consolidation left many older medicines vulnerable to price manipulation.

**Regulatory and policy responses:** The public outrage over drug price increases, amplified by Shkreli's high-profile case, contributed to increased scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing practices. This included: (1) federal and state investigations into generic drug price collusion; (2) state-level legislation requiring drug price transparency; (3) changes to FDA policies around drug shortages and market competition; (4) greater antitrust scrutiny of pharmaceutical mergers; and (5) various legislative proposals at both state and federal levels to control drug prices. However, comprehensive federal drug price reform remained elusive until the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which gave Medicare limited price negotiation authority for some drugs.

**Outcomes for cystinuria patients:** Cystinuria remained a rare genetic disorder affecting approximately 1 in 7,000 people. Patients continued to face challenges accessing affordable treatment, though the availability of generic tiopronin eventually increased. The broader trend of specialty drug price increases meant that even generic therapies for rare diseases often remained expensive.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Shkreli's predictions and justifications:**
- **Insurance would absorb costs**: Shkreli claimed patients wouldn't pay directly. However, high drug prices ultimately resulted in increased insurance premiums, higher out-of-pocket costs, and some patients being unable to access medications, undermining the claim that patients wouldn't bear the burden.

- **New formulations would benefit patients**: Retrophin promised improved formulations. While time-release formulations could theoretically improve patient convenience, the primary motivation appeared to be creating regulatory barriers to generic competition rather than clinical innovation. The strategy succeeded in delaying generic competition temporarily, but generic tiopronin eventually reached the market.

- **No payer pushback**: Shkreli predicted insurers wouldn't resist the price increases. In reality, the massive price increases became a national scandal that drew widespread payer and regulatory backlash, limiting similar price-gouging strategies in the future.

- **Better supply reliability**: Shkreli claimed Mission Pharmacal had supply problems. The supply issues for older generics remained an ongoing problem, but the solution wasn't massive price increases—instead, it highlighted the need for better manufacturing incentives and regulatory oversight of drug shortages.

**Author's implicit predictions:**
- **Regulatory rent-seeking would proliferate**: The author correctly identified this as a dangerous precedent. Similar strategies were indeed attempted by other companies, though the massive public backlash and regulatory scrutiny that followed limited widespread adoption of such extreme tactics.

- **Regulatory loopholes needed fixing**: The FDA and policymakers gradually addressed some of these issues through changes to generic approval processes, anti-competitive practice investigations, and drug shortage protocols, though the reforms were often incremental rather than comprehensive.

- **The market would correct itself**: Generic competition eventually emerged for tiopronin, as predicted by market economics, though this took longer than it should have due to the regulatory barriers.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This article captured a pivotal moment in pharmaceutical industry history—the emergence of pharmaceutical price manipulation as a business strategy—featuring one of the most controversial figures in modern healthcare. It documented early warning signs of systemic problems in generic drug markets that would later explode into national scandals and policy debates. The intersection of social media, regulatory loopholes, and patient access makes this historically significant both for pharmaceutical policy and internet culture.
