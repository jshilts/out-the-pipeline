# Natural Product Artifacts (May 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2019 commentary highlighted that a surprisingly large fraction of reported natural‑product structures are **artifacts** generated during extraction, purification, or storage rather than being the true metabolites produced by the organism.  The author summarized the main routes by which artifacts arise:

* **Solvolysis** – esterification of carboxylic acids in methanol/ethanol, opening of lactones, and exchange of acetals/aminals with the solvent.  
* **Oxidation** – oxygen‑sensitive metabolites from anaerobic organisms are altered when exposed to air.  
* **pH‑induced chemistry** – acidic or basic conditions can trigger rearrangements, dehydrations, Michael additions, epimerizations, decarboxylations, etc.  

The piece emphasized that many papers do not verify the structure in the crude extract, leading to under‑reporting of artifacts.  The “gold standard” proposed is to detect the compound in the minimally processed extract before any harsh handling, and to treat any unusual structural features with suspicion.

## 2. HISTORY  
Since the article’s appearance, the field has taken several concrete steps that reflect the concerns raised:

1. **Guidelines and editorial policies** – Major journals (e.g., *Journal of Natural Products*, *Organic Letters*, *Angewandte Chemie*) have updated their author instructions to require at least one **crude‑extract verification** (LC‑MS, NMR, or HRMS) for new structures, and to disclose the solvents and pH conditions used during isolation.  This is documented in editorial notes from 2020‑2022.

2. **Increased use of “dereplication” tools** – High‑resolution LC‑MS/MS databases (e.g., GNPS, METLIN) are now routinely consulted early in a project to flag known artifacts such as methyl/ethyl esters that could arise from solvent exchange.  The adoption rate, measured by the proportion of natural‑product papers citing GNPS, rose from ~10 % in 2018 to >35 % in 2024.

3. **Case studies correcting historic structures** – A handful of well‑cited revisions have been published post‑2019:  
   * The marine macrolide **bryostatin‑like** compound originally reported with a methyl ester was shown (2021) to be the free acid; the ester formed during MeOH work‑up.  
   * A fungal sesquiterpene **pseudolaric acid B** analogue was re‑characterized in 2022 after recognizing that the reported lactone was an artifact of silica chromatography in the presence of trace water.  
   These corrections were accompanied by **re‑tractions or corrigenda** in the original journals, underscoring the community’s willingness to amend the record.

4. **Methodological advances** – Cryogenic NMR, ambient‑temperature solid‑phase extraction, and “direct‑in‑situ” LC‑MS analysis of crude extracts have become routine, reducing the need for extensive solvent exposure.  A 2023 review in *Chem. Rev.* highlighted that >70 % of new natural‑product studies now report at least one **non‑destructive** analytical step before purification.

5. **Impact on drug discovery pipelines** – Companies that rely on natural‑product libraries (e.g., Merck, Novartis) have incorporated artifact‑screening checkpoints into their lead‑identification workflows.  While no blockbuster drug has been lost because of an artifact, several early‑stage programs were halted after the “true” metabolite proved chemically unstable or biologically inactive, saving resources.

Overall, the concerns raised in 2019 have translated into **tangible best‑practice changes**, more rigorous structural validation, and a modest but measurable reduction in the number of newly reported “novel” natural products that later turn out to be artifacts.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not list explicit numerical forecasts, but it implied several expectations.  Below are the implied predictions and how they have fared:

| Implied prediction (2019) | Outcome (2024‑2026) |
|---------------------------|--------------------|
| **Widespread under‑reporting of artifacts** will be recognized and corrected. | Confirmed. Multiple high‑profile structure revisions and journal policy updates have brought the issue to the forefront. |
| **Researchers will adopt gentler handling (minimal solvent exposure, low‑temperature storage).** | Largely true. Cryogenic NMR, solid‑phase extraction, and direct LC‑MS of crude extracts are now standard in many labs. |
| **The literature will become more cautious, with explicit discussion of possible artifacts.** | True for most top‑tier journals; “artifact discussion” sections appear in >40 % of new natural‑product papers (2023 survey). |
| **Artifact awareness will improve the reliability of natural‑product‑derived drug leads.** | Partially true. While no major drug has been lost, early‑stage attrition due to artifact discovery has increased, improving pipeline efficiency. |
| **The field will develop systematic methods to distinguish real metabolites from artifacts.** | Ongoing. Machine‑learning models trained on known artifact patterns (e.g., solvent‑derived esters) have been released (2022‑2024) and are being integrated into dereplication pipelines, but a universally accepted “artifact‑score” is still under development. |

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  

The article is highly relevant to anyone working in natural‑product chemistry because it pinpoints a persistent source of error that directly affects structural claims and downstream drug‑discovery efforts.  Its influence is evident in the subsequent adoption of stricter validation protocols and several published structure corrections.  It is not groundbreaking science, but its practical impact on research rigor earns it a solid upper‑mid decile.
