# A Terrific Paper on the Problems in Drug Discovery (February 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses a quantitative analysis by Jack Scannell and Jim Bosley published in PLoS ONE examining the productivity crisis in drug discovery. The paper uses decision theory to analyze why, despite massive improvements in screening technologies, medicinal chemistry, and other drug discovery tools over decades, R&D productivity has actually declined. The authors found that drug candidates are more likely to fail in clinical trials today than in the 1970s, and R&D costs per approved drug doubled approximately every 9 years between 1950-2010.

The key insight is that "predictive validity" (PV)—how well assays and disease models correlate with actual clinical outcomes—is far more important than brute-force efficiency gains. Scannell and Bosley hypothesize that the decline in R&D efficiency stems from the "progressive exhaustion" of highly predictive models, forcing research to shift toward diseases where only poor predictive models exist (like Alzheimer's). The paper argues that small changes in predictive validity can offset massive improvements in technical efficiency, and that the pharmaceutical industry may have become over-reliant on highly reductionist models with low predictive value because they are easier to measure and manage than assessing true model validity.

## 2. HISTORY

The analysis proved remarkably prescient. Between 2016-2024, the issues identified in the paper continued to manifest across the biotechnology industry:

**Continued struggles with predictive validity**: Alzheimer's disease research saw multiple high-profile failures that validated the paper's concerns. Eli Lilly's solanezumab failed in 2016, and other major programs continued to struggle. The amyloid hypothesis, despite billions in investment, only achieved limited validation with Biogen's aducanumab (approved 2021 but with controversial efficacy) and lecanemab (2023), neither of which demonstrated transformative clinical impact matching the investment.

**Rare disease success**: The paper's prediction that post-2012 approvals might concentrate in rare diseases with strong genetic signatures proved accurate. Between 2016-2024, rare disease drugs constituted a growing percentage of FDA approvals, including breakthrough therapies for spinal muscular atrophy (Spinraza, Zolgensma), hereditary angioedema, and various genetic metabolic disorders. These successes often leveraged strong target validation from human genetics.

**Industry adaptation**: Pharmaceutical companies increasingly recognized the predictive validity problem. Many began investing more heavily in human genetics, real-world evidence, and translational biomarkers to improve predictive models. Companies like Regeneron built extensive human genetics databases to guide target selection, explicitly addressing the predictive validity challenge.

**Cost trends continued**: R&D costs continued rising. Studies showed average drug development costs exceeding $2.8 billion by 2022, with oncology drugs often exceeding $4 billion, validating the paper's concern about unsustainable cost growth driven by predictive validity failures.

**Reproducibility crisis**: The broader scientific reproducibility crisis in biomedical research continued, with multiple initiatives launched to address preclinical reproducibility, confirming the paper's connection between predictive validity and reproducibility problems.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained explicit and implicit predictions that can be evaluated with hindsight:

- **Prediction**: Post-2012 increase in approvals might concentrate in rare diseases and cancers with strong genetic signatures  
  **Outcome**: **Accurate**. FDA approvals 2016-2024 showed disproportionate success in rare diseases and genetically-defined cancer subtypes.

- **Prediction**: Alzheimer's research would continue to struggle due to poor predictive models  
  **Outcome**: **Accurate**. Multiple high-profile Alzheimer's failures occurred post-2016, including major Phase 3 trials.

- **Prediction**: The predictive validity problem would become more widely recognized as a central challenge  
  **Outcome**: **Accurate**. Human genetics, biomarkers, and translational research gained prominence as the industry grappled with predictive models.

- **Prediction**: Thinking in terms of "domains of validity" would become more important  
  **Outcome**: **Partially accurate**. While discussed more in specialized circles, this hasn't fundamentally transformed decision-making at most organizations.

- **Prediction**: Improvements in predictive models would be a major rate-limiting step in drug discovery  
  **Outcome**: **Accurate**. Target validation and predictive biomarkers remain central challenges, particularly for complex diseases.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This article demonstrated exceptionally high long-term importance by providing a quantitative framework that explained the persistent productivity crisis in drug discovery. Its core insight about the critical role of predictive validity relative to technical efficiency has been validated by subsequent industry experience and has influenced how both companies and investors approach R&D strategy.
