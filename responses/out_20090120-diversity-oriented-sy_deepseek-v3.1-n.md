# Diversity-Oriented Synthesis: Oriented The Right Way? (January 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Diversity-Oriented Synthesis (DOS), an approach to chemical synthesis that aims to produce the maximum number of diverse molecular structures and scaffolds from a single synthetic scheme, populating chemical space efficiently. Unlike natural product synthesis which focuses on one molecule at a time, DOS creates discrete, diverse compounds for biological screening libraries.

The article highlights a 2009 paper from Adam Nelson's group at Leeds using olefin metathesis with fluorous tagging to generate approximately 80 different scaffolds in just 5-6 steps. Stuart Schreiber advocated this approach, arguing that commercial screening libraries lack sufficient diversity despite containing millions of compounds—they're too structurally similar, achiral, and simple, leading to poor hit rates against challenging targets like protein-protein interactions.

However, the author raises concerns about the Leeds compounds: they contain no basic nitrogens (all capped with nosyl groups), are heavy on alkenes, use problematic silyl ketal linking groups, and may be more suited as chemical biology tools rather than actual drug development candidates. The central tension identified is academic focus on in vitro pathway discovery versus industry's need for viable drug leads.

## 2. HISTORY

**Academic Development and Evolution:**
Following 2009, DOS continued primarily as an academic pursuit. The field matured methodologically, with researchers developing more sophisticated approaches including DNA-encoded libraries (DEL), fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD), and DEL-FBDD hybrid platforms. Nelson's group and others expanded DOS strategies to create more drug-like molecules.

**Industrial Adoption Patterns:**
The prediction about chemical vendors was partially correct but not transformative. While companies like Enamine and multinational CROs offered DOS-derived libraries, large pharma generally preferred fragment-based approaches and structure-based drug design over pure DOS. GSK's acquisition of Conformal in 2007 (DNA-encoded library technology) showed one path, but widespread DOS adoption in big pharma didn't materialize as hoped.

**Shift to Protein-Protein Interaction Modulators:**
The field evolved toward addressing "undruggable" targets, particularly protein-protein interactions (PPIs). However, success came more from structural biology-guided design than random diversity screening. Biologics and PROTACs emerged as alternative solutions to difficult targets.

**Notable Successes and Limitations:**
While no blockbuster drugs emerged directly from early DOS approaches, the philosophy influenced library design strategies. The focus on 3D complexity and stereochemical diversity informed modern library construction. However, Schreiber's vision of small, highly diverse libraries replacing massive high-throughput screening campaigns didn't fully materialize due to the importance of compound quality over sheer diversity.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Chemical vendors might commercialize DOS libraries"** - **Mixed outcome**: Companies like Enamine offered DOS-inspired libraries, but these represented a niche market rather than transforming drug discovery supply chains. Most vendors continued focusing on traditional libraries that pharmaceutical companies actually purchased.

• **"Drug company folks might adopt DOS approaches"** - **Largely incorrect**: Large pharmaceutical companies showed limited interest in pure DOS strategies. They gravitated toward fragment-based drug discovery, DNA-encoded libraries, and structure-guided approaches instead. Academic-industry collaboration increased, but not through wholesale DOS adoption.

• **"DOS needed for undruggable targets"** - **Partially validated but different solutions emerged**: Protein-protein interaction modulators did become important, but solutions came from multiple approaches including macrocycles, stapled peptides, and later PROTACs, rather than DOS libraries specifically. The field's direction was right; the method wasn't the primary solution.

• **"Basic nitrogen incorporation needed"** - **Validated by field evolution**: Subsequent DOS work emphasized incorporating drug-like features such as basic nitrogen (replacing nosyl caps with removable groups), reducing problematic functionality like silyl ketals, and better balancing complexity with drug-likeness.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article captured an important moment in medicinal chemistry methodology debates, but DOS ultimately proved to be an evolutionary rather than revolutionary approach that occupied a modest academic niche. The discussion of academic-industry gaps and library design philosophy remains relevant to drug discovery strategy and early-stage tool development.
