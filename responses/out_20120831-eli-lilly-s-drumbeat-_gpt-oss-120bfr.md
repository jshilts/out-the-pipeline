# Eli Lilly’s Drumbeat of Bad News (August 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author laments a string of setbacks at Eli Lilly that were reported in the summer of 2012. Three high‑profile programs are highlighted:

* **Solanezumab**, an anti‑amyloid‑β monoclonal antibody for Alzheimer’s disease, missed all clinical endpoints in its Phase III trial, though the company claimed a “signal” in a subgroup.  
* **Pomaglumetad methionil (LY2140023)**, a pro‑drug of the metabotropic glutamate‑2/3 agonist LY‑404,039 for schizophrenia, failed its first large‑scale trial and was halted.  
* **Effient (prasugrel)**, Lilly’s oral P2Y₁₂ inhibitor, lost a head‑to‑head study against the generic antiplatelet clopidogrel (Plavix) in acute coronary syndrome, showing no clear superiority.

The piece also mentions earlier disappointments (a gamma‑secretase inhibitor) and praises Lilly for pursuing “high‑risk” mechanisms such as β‑secretase inhibition in Alzheimer’s, arguing that the company’s portfolio is neither reckless nor overly conservative.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Solanezumab (Alzheimer’s disease)  
* **2012‑2014** – After the failed EXPEDITION 1/2 trials (2012), Lilly combined data with Eli Lilly’s partner Eli Lilly (actually Eli Lilly was the sponsor) and launched EXPEDITION 3 in 2014. The trial again failed to meet its primary cognitive endpoint.  
* **2015‑2022** – The antibody was tested in a secondary‑prevention trial (AHEAD 3‑45) that enrolled cognitively normal participants with amyloid accumulation. The study was stopped for futility in early 2022, confirming that solanezumab does not provide clinical benefit.  
* **Commercial outcome** – The program was discontinued; no FDA approval was ever granted.

### Pomaglumetad methionil (LY2140023) – schizophrenia  
* **2012** – After the Phase IIb/III failure reported in August 2012, Lilly formally halted development.  
* **Subsequent attempts** – The parent compound LY‑404,039 (the active moiety) was later investigated by other companies (e.g., Roche’s “RG‑1678”) but never reached market.  
* **Commercial outcome** – The molecule never advanced beyond early‑stage trials; the investment was written off.

### Effient (prasugrel) – antiplatelet therapy  
* **2012** – The head‑to‑head trial (TRITON‑TIMI 38) had already shown prasugrel reduced ischemic events versus clopidogrel in high‑risk PCI patients, but with higher bleeding risk. The 2012 ACS comparison reaffirmed no clear superiority in the broader ACS population.  
* **Post‑2012 market** – Prasugrel remains an FDA‑approved drug (2010) but is prescribed mainly for patients undergoing PCI who can tolerate higher bleeding risk. It never displaced clopidogrel as the “standard of care.”  
* **Commercial outcome** – Moderate sales; not a blockbuster.

### Gamma‑secretase inhibitor (semagacestat)  
* **2010** – The Phase III trial was halted after worsening cognition and increased skin cancer risk. The failure was already public before the 2012 article.  
* **Impact** – The setback discouraged further industry investment in gamma‑secretase inhibition for Alzheimer’s.

### β‑secretase (BACE) inhibitors – Lilly’s efforts  
* **LY2886721** – A Lilly BACE1 inhibitor entered Phase II in 2014 but was discontinued in 2015 due to liver toxicity.  
* **Other BACE programs** – Merck’s verubecestat and Janssen’s atabecestat also failed in late‑stage trials (2017‑2019). No BACE inhibitor has achieved regulatory approval to date.  

### Overall Lilly trajectory (2012‑2026)  
* **Successes** – Several unrelated products have become major revenue drivers:  
  * **Trulicity (dulaglutide)**, a GLP‑1 receptor agonist approved 2014, now a top‑selling diabetes drug.  
  * **Mounjaro (tirzepatide)**, a dual GIP/GLP‑1 agonist approved 2022, quickly became a blockbuster for type 2 diabetes and obesity.  
  * **Oncology** – Acquisition of Loxo Oncology (2019) delivered **Vitrakvi (larotrectinib)** (2020) and **Retevmo (selpercatinib)** (2020), both FDA‑approved targeted therapies.  
* **R&D spending** – Lilly’s R&D budget grew from ≈$5 bn in 2012 to >$9 bn in 2023, reflecting continued investment in high‑risk biology despite the 2012 setbacks.  
* **Financial health** – Market cap rose from ~\$70 bn (2012) to >\$300 bn (2025), driven largely by the diabetes/obesity franchise and oncology acquisitions, not by the Alzheimer’s or psychiatric programs discussed in the article.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from article) | What actually happened |
|----------------------------|------------------------|
| **Solanezumab might eventually show benefit** (author notes “some signs” in sub‑groups) | Subsequent Phase III trials (EXPEDITION 3, AHEAD 3‑45) failed; the drug was discontinued with no clinical benefit demonstrated. |
| **Pomaglumetad methionil will be abandoned** (author expects “disappear”) | Development was halted in 2012; the molecule never returned to the clinic. |
| **Effient will not beat Plavix** (author notes lack of superiority) | Prasugrel never overtook clopidogrel as the primary antiplatelet; it remains a niche, higher‑bleeding‑risk option. |
| **Gamma‑secretase inhibition is a dead end** (author cites earlier failure) | Semagacestat’s failure confirmed the mechanism’s safety issues; no company has advanced a gamma‑secretase inhibitor to approval. |
| **β‑secretase (BACE) inhibition will be a “best idea” for Alzheimer’s** (author is optimistic) | Multiple BACE inhibitors, including Lilly’s LY2886721, were discontinued for safety or lack of efficacy; the approach has not yielded an approved therapy. |
| **Lilly’s overall R&D strategy is “high‑risk but not reckless”** | The company continued to fund ambitious programs (e.g., tirzepatide, oncology targets) and achieved blockbuster successes, supporting the view that a balanced risk portfolio can pay off. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment when several high‑profile, high‑risk programs failed, offering a clear lens on how biotech firms manage risk and how those specific failures shaped later R&D directions. Its relevance persists because the same therapeutic areas (Alzheimer’s, psychiatric drugs, antiplatelets) remain challenging, and Lilly’s subsequent turnaround illustrates the long‑term impact of such setbacks.
