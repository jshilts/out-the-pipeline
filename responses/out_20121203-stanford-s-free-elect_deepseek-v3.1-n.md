# Stanford's Free Electron Laser Blasts Away (December 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses a groundbreaking X-ray crystallography technique using Stanford's free electron laser (FEL) to determine protein structures. The method addresses the fundamental problem of radiation damage in traditional crystallography by using extremely short, intense X-ray pulses that capture diffraction data before the crystal is destroyed. The specific study achieved a 2.1 Ångstrom resolution structure of T. brucei cathepsin B enzyme using nearly 4 million snapshots from a stream of small crystals exposed at room temperature. Two particularly innovative aspects were highlighted: the use of room-temperature measurements instead of cryogenic conditions, and the use of crystals formed directly inside insect cells via baculovirus expression rather than purified protein crystallized in vitro.

## 2. HISTORY
The 2012 paper heralded the beginning of a new era in structural biology. In the subsequent decade, X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) facilities proliferated globally, with major installations at SLAC (LCLS), SACLA (Japan), European XFEL (Germany), and PAL-XFEL (South Korea). The serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) technique demonstrated in this paper became a standard method for studying radiation-sensitive proteins, membrane proteins, and enzymes that are difficult to crystallize by traditional methods.

However, the impact was more nuanced than initially suggested. While XFEL facilities produced numerous high-profile structures, traditional synchrotron sources remained the workhorse of structural biology due to lower costs and broader accessibility. The promise of "damage-free" imaging proved somewhat optimistic—while radiation damage is minimized, other technical challenges emerged including sample delivery complexities, data processing requirements, and the stochastic nature of collecting complete datasets from randomly oriented crystals.

The technique found particular success in specific niches: time-resolved studies of enzymatic reactions, membrane protein structures (especially GPCRs), and proteins containing metal clusters sensitive to conventional radiation. Published XFEL structures reached over 500 by 2022, with notable successes including photosystem complexes, viral proteins, and drug targets. However, adoption remained limited to specialized facilities, and the claimed advantages of in-cell crystallization never became a widely adopted methodology, with most subsequent studies using traditional purification and crystallization approaches.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7**

This article describes a genuinely transformative methodological advance in structural biology that opened new avenues for studying challenging proteins, though the technique remained specialized rather than becoming universally adopted.
