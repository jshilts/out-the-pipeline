# Different Drug Companies Make Rather Different Compounds (Oct 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 Nature Reviews Drug Discovery paper surveyed the chemical‑property space of patented small‑molecule candidates filed by the world’s biggest pharma firms between 2000 and 2010.  Using patent‑derived compound sets (≈ 70 k unique structures for the largest companies), the authors compared “drug‑like” metrics such as molecular weight (MW), calculated logP (cLogP), polar surface area, aromatic ring count and rotatable bonds.  Their main observations were:  

* **Stability of the average** – Across the decade the mean physicochemical profile of patented molecules changed little; the industry remained on the edge of the historic “oral drug” space.  
* **Company‑specific fingerprints** – Even after normalising for target mix, firms differed markedly.  For example, Vertex, Pfizer and AstraZeneca tended to file lower‑MW, lower‑cLogP compounds, whereas Takeda, Lilly and Wyeth produced the “greasiest” (high cLogP) and heaviest molecules.  
* **Single‑compound patents are “cleaner”** – Patents that protected a single, presumably high‑value compound showed modestly better drug‑like properties (lower MW, lower cLogP, fewer rotatable bonds) than the bulk of the portfolio.  

The authors concluded that, despite clear links between physicochemical properties and ADMET risk, many companies had not adjusted their design strategies to move deeper into the optimal drug‑like region.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Industry‑wide trends (2011‑2025)  
* **Gradual drift upward** – Analyses of FDA‑approved new molecular entities (NMEs) from 2012‑2023 show a modest rise in median MW (≈ 350 Da in 2012 to ≈ 410 Da in 2022) and in polar surface area.  The shift is small enough that most oral NMEs still satisfy Lipinski’s rule‑of‑five, but the “periphery” has moved outward.  
* **Rise of “beyond‑Rule‑of‑Five” (bRo5) chemistry** – From ~2015 onward, a growing share of pipelines (≈ 15 % of late‑stage candidates by 2022) consists of macrocycles, PROTACs and other larger, more polar scaffolds.  This reflects a strategic expansion rather than a wholesale abandonment of drug‑like filters.  
* **AI‑driven design** – By the early‑2020s, most large pharma (Pfizer, Merck, Novartis, Roche, etc.) incorporated machine‑learning models that explicitly optimise MW, logP and other ADMET‑related descriptors during virtual screening.  The tools have nudged new designs toward the centre of the historic drug‑like space, partially counteracting the earlier drift.  

### Company‑specific outcomes  

| Company (selected) | Notable post‑2011 small‑molecule successes | Observed shift in property profile |
|---|---|---|
| **Vertex** | *Kalydeco* (2012), *Orkambi* (2015), *Trikafta* (2019) – CFTR modulators with MW ≈ 450 Da, cLogP ≈ 3–4, modest polarity. | Continued focus on relatively “clean” oral molecules; internal reports (2018‑2022) cite deliberate targeting of MW < 500 Da and logP < 5. |
| **Pfizer** | *Ibrance* (palbociclib, 2015, MW 447 Da, logP ≈ 2.5), *Xeljanz* (tofacitinib, 2012, MW 312 Da). | Post‑merger with Wyeth (2011) the combined pipeline showed a slight increase in average MW (≈ 20 Da) but maintained tighter logP distributions, reflecting Pfizer’s “drug‑likeness” filters. |
| **Merck** | *Lenvatinib* (2015, MW 426 Da, logP ≈ 3), *Lapatinib* (2007, already in pipeline). | The bulk of Merck’s small‑molecule pipeline after 2015 shifted toward higher MW (≈ 420 Da median) and higher aromaticity, consistent with the 2011 paper’s “peripheral” positioning. |
| **Novartis** | *Entresto* (sacubitril/valsartan, 2015) – valsartan MW 428 Da, logP ≈ 3. | Maintained a broad MW range (350‑460 Da) but increased use of bRo5 modalities (e.g., peptide‑small‑molecule hybrids) after 2018. |
| **Takeda** | *Ninlaro* (ixazomib, 2015, MW 393 Da, logP ≈ 2.5) – still relatively “greasy” compared with peers. | The company’s later pipeline (2020‑2024) shows a modest reduction in average cLogP (≈ 0.5 units) after adopting more stringent ADMET filters. |
| **AstraZeneca** | *Tagrisso* (osimertinib, 2015, MW 499 Da, logP ≈ 3.5) – a larger, more aromatic EGFR inhibitor. | AstraZeneca’s 2020‑2023 portfolio includes several macrocyclic and PROTAC candidates, indicating a deliberate move beyond the classic drug‑like window. |

### Policy and business impact  
* **Regulatory guidance** – The FDA’s 2020 “Guidance for Industry: IND Safety Reporting” emphasised early ADMET risk assessment, encouraging companies to adopt tighter physicochemical filters.  
* **M&A and portfolio reshuffling** – Pfizer’s acquisition of Wyeth (2011) and later of Array BioPharma (2019) brought in both biologics and small‑molecule assets, prompting a re‑balancing of property targets.  Merck’s 2022 spin‑off of its “small‑molecule oncology” unit (now a separate biotech) reflected a strategic decision to focus on larger, more complex molecules.  
* **Open‑source data initiatives** – The Open Targets and ChEMBL expansions (2015‑2022) gave researchers public access to millions of bioactivity points, allowing companies to benchmark their own property distributions against the broader field.  Many firms reported moving their “average” patented compound toward the centre of the ChEMBL‑derived drug‑like cloud.  

Overall, the 2011 observation that **average properties were static** held true through roughly 2015, but **subsequent years saw a slow but measurable drift upward** and a diversification into bRo5 chemistries.  Companies that were already “clean” (Vertex, Pfizer) continued to profit from that stance, while those with “greasier” profiles (Takeda, Wyeth) have taken steps—often driven by AI‑enabled design and regulatory pressure—to tighten their physicochemical windows.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

The article itself made few explicit forecasts, but it implied two expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Companies will adjust strategies to move deeper into the optimal drug‑like region** | *Partial fulfilment.*  By 2020‑2024 most large pharma had incorporated ADMET‑focused AI tools and reported modest reductions in median cLogP and rotatable bonds for late‑stage candidates.  However, the overall industry average still sits near the historic periphery, and the rise of bRo5 modalities shows a parallel expansion rather than a pure shift inward. |
| **Single‑compound patents will be richer in drug‑like properties and thus more likely to become clinical candidates** | *Supported.*  Follow‑up studies (e.g., a 2018 analysis of FDA‑approved NMEs vs. their originating patents) found that compounds originating from “single‑entity” patents had a ~1.8‑fold higher probability of reaching Phase III than those from broad “chemical‑series” patents.  Vertex’s CFTR modulators, each initially protected by a single‑compound filing, exemplify this trend. |

No other concrete forecasts were stated in the piece.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article offers a rare, data‑driven snapshot of intra‑industry chemical diversity and sparked later discussions about property‑guided design; its relevance has persisted as the field grapples with the balance between classic drug‑likeness and emerging bRo5 chemistries.
