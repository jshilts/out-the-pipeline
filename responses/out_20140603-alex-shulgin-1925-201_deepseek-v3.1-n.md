# Alex Shulgin, 1925-2014 (June 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The June 2014 article by Derek Lowe announces the death of Alexander "Sasha" Shulgin at age 88, describing him as a pioneering pharmacologist and chemist who became legendary within psychedelic drug culture. The piece recounts that Shulgin authored PIHKAL and TIHKAL (Phenethylamines/Tryptamines I Have Known And Loved), was an accomplished organic chemist, and conducted extensive self-experimentation with these compounds with a circle of friends. The article contrasts Shulgin's earlier era, when many psychoactive compounds were not illegal, with the contemporary "designer drug" scene where people sell untested compounds for profit. Lowe notes that Shulgin published papers—often appearing in mainstream journals like the Journal of Organic Chemistry—with explicit descriptions of human psychoactive effects on the Shulgin Rating Scale. Despite personally disagreeing with Shulgin's philosophical stance on altered states, Lowe expresses admiration for Shulgin's authentic scientific curiosity, distinguishing Shulgin as a serious investigator who risked his own neurons rather than others'.

## 2. HISTORY

I should note that this article is an obituary rather than a forward-looking piece about the biotechnology industry, and evaluating it for "what happened after" is not straightforward. That said, some subsequent developments are relevant:

- **Academic and clinical developments in psychedelics**: Research on psychedelic compounds continued, with psilocybin and MDMA (which Shulgin resynthesized and reintroduced to psychologists) gaining traction in clinical trials. MDMA-assisted therapy advanced through Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials for treatment-resistant PTSD, with promising results. Psilocybin research expanded for depression, anxiety, and end-of-life distress, leading to the design of larger trials under FDA guidelines.

- **Regulatory aspects**: "Designer drugs" proliferated after 2014, often marketed as "bath salts" or "legal highs," triggering legislative responses such as the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act and ongoing DEA scheduling actions. At the same time, breakthrough therapy designations were granted for some psychedelic-assisted treatments, suggesting a regulatory path distinct from the recreational market.

- **Scientific methods and rigor**: The kind of phenomenological, small-sample human self-experimentation reported in Shulgin's papers became less common in mainstream journals, while controlled, dose-ranging studies with validated instruments grew. Journals increasingly required structured protocols, ethics approvals, and standardized endpoints rather than open-ended narrative reports.

- **Industry activity**: Companies exploring psychedelic therapeutics emerged and some raised substantial funding (e.g., Compass Pathways developing psilocybin therapy for depression). These efforts focus on formulated, cGMP-produced drug product rather than novel chemical matter from individual chemists.

- **Legacy and reception**: Shulgin's books remained influential; PIHKAL and TIHKAL are treated as reference works by researchers, clinicians, and harm reduction groups. Many of the compounds he described or synthesized are controlled substances, and few have approved medical uses.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article is an obituary and contains no explicit predictions about future events; it reflects on the contrast between Shulgin's era and the contemporary synthetic drug market. Since there are no predictions to evaluate against subsequent outcomes, this section does not apply.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This obituary is a thoughtful reflection on scientific methods and personal philosophy, but it is not core biotechnology industry commentary and has limited utility for analyzing industry outcomes or clinical pipelines.
