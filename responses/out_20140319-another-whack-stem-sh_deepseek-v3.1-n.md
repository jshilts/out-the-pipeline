# Another Whack at the Stem Shortage Myth (March 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 article discusses Michael Teitelbaum's analysis debunking the "STEM shortage" narrative in the United States. Teitelbaum examined employment data showing that U.S. higher education produces far more science and engineering graduates than available job openings—potentially 100% to 200% more supply than demand. The evidence he presented included stagnant or slow-growing real wages in many STEM occupations and unemployment rates as high or higher than comparably-skilled fields, both indicators contradicting claims of labor shortages.

The article identifies specific groups that benefit from promoting the STEM shortage narrative: high-tech companies seeking to suppress wages and lobby for looser immigration policies to access cheaper overseas workers, universities wanting more funding for science programs, and immigration lawyers pursuing work visa business. The author notes this aligns with their own conclusions, while acknowledging that the cyclical nature of interest in science (peaking every 10-15 years) contributes to the persistence of this myth.

## 2. HISTORY

In the decade following this 2014 article, the STEM shortage debate continued with evolving evidence and perspectives. Several major reports and studies emerged that largely corroborated Teitelbaum's analysis, while the tech industry experienced dramatic shifts that affected STEM labor markets. The most significant post-2014 development was detailed workforce analyses by organizations including the National Science Foundation, Economic Policy Institute, and various academic researchers who consistently found no evidence of systemic STEM shortages.

Real wage trends in many STEM fields remained relatively flat or grew modestly through much of the 2010s, particularly in traditional research positions, supporting the article's contention. However, certain high-demand tech specialties (AI/ML, cybersecurity, data science) experienced wage growth and tighter labor markets during specific periods, mainly mid-to-late 2010s. The H-1B visa program continued to be controversial, with numerous analyses showing tech companies were the primary beneficiaries while wage suppression effects were documented in several studies.

Major policy shifts included the Trump administration's restrictions on H-1B visas and Biden administration's subsequent modifications, with debates continuing about whether immigration policies should primarily serve employer interests versus domestic worker protection. Universities continued expanding STEM programs with federal and state funding support, producing graduates at rates often exceeding job creation in many STEM fields.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The "critical shortage of scientists and engineers" idea would continue persisting despite contrary evidence.
  - **Outcome**: This proved accurate. The STEM shortage narrative continued appearing in policy discussions, industry lobbying, and media coverage throughout the 2010s and beyond, though with more nuanced recognition of field-specific variations.

• **Implicit prediction**: Wage trends would remain flat or slow-growing, indicating no genuine shortage.
  - **Outcome**: Partially accurate for traditional STEM research positions, but oversimplified. Certain tech specialties experienced significant wage growth and tight labor markets, particularly during the tech boom periods of 2015-2018 and 2020-2022.

• **Implicit prediction**: The cycle of STEM hype would continue every 10-15 years.
  - **Outcome**: Partially validated. While STEM received sustained attention through the 2010s, the COVID-19 pandemic brought renewed focus on biotechnology and public health-related STEM fields, though this represented more crisis-driven rather than cyclical attention.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article addressed a persistently misleading narrative in science and technology workforce policy with substantial real-world implications for wage levels, immigration policy, and educational funding. While focused on labor economics rather than biotechnology directly, the STEM shortage myth significantly impacted biotech and pharmaceutical workforce dynamics, making this analysis relevant to understanding employment patterns affecting the industry. The arguments were well-supported by data and have largely held up over time, though the analysis could have benefited from more differentiation between specific STEM fields.
