# What PCSK9 Is Telling Us About Drug Discovery (March 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article examines PCSK9 inhibitors as a real-world test case for genomics-driven drug discovery. The genetic evidence was compelling: people with loss-of-function PCSK9 mutations showed extremely low LDL cholesterol and up to 90% reduced heart disease risk, making PCSK9 appear to be one of the most actionable targets from human genetics.

The drug development pathway involved antibody therapies rather than small molecules, with Regeneron/Sanofi and Amgen leading the way while Pfizer dropped out due to immunogenicity issues. The article focuses on disappointing real-world trial results from Amgen's outcomes study—while cardiovascular risk decreased by 15%, the reduction was smaller than hoped (20-25%), and crucially, there was no improvement in overall mortality. This raised questions about whether recapitulating genetic knockout effects pharmacologically in adults could deliver the same benefits as lifelong genetic mutations.

The article also highlighted the cost dilemma: expensive PCSK9 antibodies faced insurance rejections compared to cheap generic statins, while noting the irony that statins may work partly through off-target effects—a "dirty" small molecule outperforming a highly selective antibody.

## 2. HISTORY

**Clinical Trial Outcomes Continued to Evolve**

The FOURIER trial (Amgen's evolocumab) published full results showing 15% relative risk reduction in major cardiovascular events, with effects appearing to strengthen over time. Subsequent longer-term data and meta-analyses eventually demonstrated mortality benefits, particularly in high-risk patients.

**FDA Approvals and Market Penetration**
- **Alirocumab (Praluent, Regeneron/Sanofi)**: Approved 2015, cardiovascular outcomes data showed similar efficacy
- **Evolocumab (Repatha, Amgen)**: Approved 2015, eventually gained broader indications

**Real-World Access and Economics**
Both drugs faced significant payer restrictions initially due to high costs (~$14,000/year). Amgen eventually cut Repatha's price by 60% in 2018 to improve access. Patient access programs and outcomes-based contracts helped gradually improve utilization.

**Expanded Indications**
The medications gained broader FDA approvals beyond just familial hypercholesterolemia to include established cardiovascular disease, making them available to larger patient populations.

**Small Molecule Development**
The article's acknowledgment that PCSK9 lacked small molecule binding sites proved prescient—despite industry efforts, oral PCSK9 inhibitors remained elusive for years, though research continued on alternative approaches.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"The slam-dunk game-winning ending is already gone"** - The author suggested PCSK9 inhibitors wouldn't revolutionize cardiovascular treatment as dramatically as genetic data suggested.
  - **Outcome**: Partially accurate. While uptake was slower than expected due to cost and access issues, PCSK9 inhibitors did establish themselves as important tools for specific high-risk populations, particularly those with familial hypercholesterolemia or statin intolerance. The revolution was more evolutionary than transformative.

• **"Recapitulating a true genetic knockout pharmacologically is not easy"** - Predicted that antibodies wouldn't match lifelong genetic effects.
  - **Outcome**: Accurate. The pharmacologic approach indeed showed more modest effects than the dramatic protection seen in genetic knockouts, reflecting differences between lifelong genetic absence versus adult-onset therapeutic intervention.

• **Implicit prediction about insurance coverage and cost-effectiveness determining adoption**
  - **Outcome**: Highly accurate. Pricing and payer restrictions remained central to market access for years, with manufacturers eventually implementing major price reductions and innovative payment models to improve utilization.

• **Suggestion that longer-term therapy might show better results**
  - **Outcome**: Partially validated. Subsequent analyses and longer follow-up did show some strengthening of treatment effects over time, though the magnitude remained more modest than initially hoped based on genetic data.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 9/10**

This article was prescient in highlighting critical issues about translating genetic discoveries into clinical practice, and PCSK9 remains one of the most important case studies in genomics-driven drug development. The tension between compelling genetic data and real-world clinical outcomes remains highly relevant as genetics continues driving therapeutic discovery.
