# Article Title (Month Year)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses a breakthrough paper from a Berkeley/UCSF research team published in Science (February 2017) that introduced a new method for labeling proteins using methionine residues. The technique uses an oxaziridine reagent to selectively oxidize methionine side chains, creating sulfimine intermediates that can then be modified with various functional groups. The article notes that while cysteine has traditionally been the go-to amino acid for protein labeling due to its reactive thiol group, methionine offers advantages because it's less likely to be involved in critical protein functions. The authors demonstrated the method's potential by engineering methionine residues into antibody fragments and creating antibody-drug conjugates with trastuzumab (Herceptin). The technique also enables identification of hyper-reactive methionine residues in the proteome, similar to how electrophile screens identify reactive cysteines.

## 2. HISTORY

The methionine-specific labeling approach described in this 2017 article has indeed opened up new avenues in chemical biology and therapeutic development:

**Scientific Adoption and Development:**
The original oxaziridine-based methionine labeling chemistry has been widely adopted by the chemical biology community. The technique is now established as a complementary method to cysteine labeling, particularly useful when cysteine residues are unavailable, buried, or functionally critical.

**Antibody-Drug Conjugate Applications:**
The article's prediction about antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) proved accurate. Methionine-based conjugation has become one of several site-specific ADC technologies. However, it competes with other established methods including cysteine-based (Thiomab) and lysine-based conjugation platforms. Several pharmaceutical companies have incorporated methionine-based bioconjugation into their ADC development pipelines, though most FDA-approved ADCs still primarily use traditional cysteine or lysine conjugation methods.

**Proteomic Applications:**
The technique for identifying hyper-reactive methionine residues has found particular utility in redox proteomics and studies of oxidative stress. Methionine oxidation is now recognized as an important post-translational modification in cellular signaling and protein regulation.

**Clinical Impact:**
While the prediction about trastuzumab conjugates was directionally correct, the methionine-based approach represents just one of multiple conjugation strategies now available. The ADC field has grown substantially since 2017, with numerous approved therapies, but most successful commercial ADCs have used other conjugation chemistries or more established site-specific methods.

**Commercial Development:**
The underlying chemistry has been incorporated into commercial reagent kits and has been licensed by biotechnology companies focusing on bioconjugation technologies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction 1: "This could open up a new area for chemical biology" and provide "a new handle, with new chemistry, on a newly useful amino acid"**
- **Outcome**: ✓ **Accurate**. Methionine labeling has become an established technique in chemical biology, widely adopted for protein modification and proteomic studies.

**Prediction 2: "Gives you a potential new route into antibody-drug conjugates" with the trastuzumab example**
- **Outcome**: ✓ **Partially accurate**. Methionine-based conjugation has indeed become a viable route for ADC development, though it hasn't become the dominant method and competes with multiple other conjugation strategies.

**Prediction 3: "Not all methionines are, either, since they can be involved in oxidative reactions in vivo"**
- **Outcome**: ✓ **Accurate**. The role of methionine oxidation in protein regulation and redox signaling has been extensively validated, and the technique has proven valuable for studying these processes.

**Prediction 4: Implied expectation of widespread adoption for antibody functionalization**
- **Outcome**: △ **Mixed**. The technique has been adopted, but primarily as one tool among many in the protein modification toolbox, rather than replacing cysteine-based methods as originally hoped.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article identified a genuinely important chemical biology advance that has delivered on its promise of providing a new protein modification handle. The technique achieved practical adoption in both research and pharmaceutical development contexts, though its impact was more modest than potentially implied - it became a valuable addition to the toolbox rather than a transformative replacement for existing methods.
