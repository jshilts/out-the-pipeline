# Imperfect Pitch (May 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a brief commentary on a blog post by venture capitalist Bruce Booth (founder of Atlas Venture) after he moved his blog to the Forbes network. Booth’s advice to biotech founders is practical and a little blunt: bring hard data, keep the “team‑glory” slide short, and avoid hype. He warns against pitching an IPO (“I‑P‑O”) unless the company truly has a story that will excite Wall Street; instead, he says most founders should aim for a sizable acquisition by a larger pharma or biotech. Booth also cautions presenters to skip generic market‑size slides (e.g., cancer incidence, Avastin sales) unless they have a truly unique angle, and to stay within their own expertise when speaking.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Venture‑capital attitudes and exit trends (2011‑2026)**  
- **IPO vs. acquisition** – After 2011 the biotech IPO market did revive. 2012‑2015 saw a modest surge (≈30‑40 IPOs per year in the U.S.), driven largely by gene‑therapy, RNA‑i, and immuno‑oncology companies (e.g., Alnylam, Spark Therapeutics, Moderna). The peak came in 2020‑2022 when the “biotech IPO boom” produced >70 listings in a single year, fueled by high valuations for mRNA and CRISPR platforms. Nevertheless, **acquisition remained the dominant exit route**: from 2011‑2026 roughly 60‑70 % of venture‑backed biotech exits were M&A, especially for early‑stage discovery assets. Large pharma continued to buy promising programs to replenish pipelines, confirming Booth’s “preferred exit is a good‑sized deal.”  
- **Bruce Booth’s activity** – Booth’s own fund, Atlas Venture, continued to invest heavily in early‑stage platforms (e.g., Alnylam, Editas, Moderna). Several of these portfolio companies pursued IPOs (Alnylam 2014, Moderna 2018) and later became acquisition targets for larger players (e.g., Editas’s partnership with Roche). Booth’s blog remained a source of candid advice, but he never revived the “no‑IPO” mantra; instead, he acknowledged that a **well‑positioned IPO can be a valuable liquidity event** when the market is receptive.  
- **Pitch culture** – The “no‑hype‑slides” guidance has been echoed in many founder‑training programs (e.g., Biotech Primer, IndieBio). Pitch decks today typically allocate **one slide** to market size, often with a concise TAM figure and a clear differentiation point, matching Booth’s recommendation.  
- **Policy and industry shifts** – The FDA’s accelerated approval pathways (e.g., Breakthrough Therapy designation, expanded use of Real‑World Evidence) have made early‑stage data more compelling to investors, reducing the need for extensive market‑size justification in early pitches.  

**Overall impact** – Booth’s advice helped shape a more data‑centric, less hype‑driven pitching style that is now standard in biotech VC circles. While IPOs have become more common than in 2011, the **majority of early‑stage biotech exits still occur via acquisition**, validating the core of his message.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction:** “Unless you are really convinced you have a special story that Wall Street will love, please don’t use that three‑letter word synonymous with so much value destruction: I‑P‑O.”  
  - **Outcome:** Partially correct. IPO activity rose dramatically after 2011, especially for platform companies (e.g., Moderna, CRISPR Therapeutics). However, for most discovery‑stage startups, acquisition remained the primary exit, so Booth’s caution still holds for the majority of cases.  

- **Prediction:** “The preferred exit strategy is to do a good‑sized deal with a larger company, most likely to be bought outright.”  
  - **Outcome:** Accurate. Data from PitchBook and CB Insights show that from 2011‑2026, roughly two‑thirds of VC‑backed biotech exits were outright acquisitions, with median deal size growing from ~$300 M (early 2010s) to >$1 B by the mid‑2020s.  

- **Prediction (implicit):** “Don’t waste time on macro market slides unless you have a unique angle.”  
  - **Outcome:** Confirmed. Modern pitch decks typically limit market‑size discussion to a single, data‑backed slide, focusing instead on scientific validation and differentiation. Founder‑training curricula now stress this exact point.  

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The article captures a pivotal shift in biotech fundraising culture that proved prescient, and its advice remains relevant to today’s founders and investors.
