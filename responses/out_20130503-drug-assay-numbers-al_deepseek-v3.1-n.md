# Drug Assay Numbers, All Over the Place (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a disturbing PLOS ONE paper revealing that biochemical assay results vary dramatically depending on compound dispensing method—traditional pipet tips versus acoustic dispensing. The researchers found that IC50 values for Ephrin type-B receptor 4 inhibitors differed by orders of magnitude between the two techniques, with no correlation between datasets.

The authors suggest the discrepancy stems from the "sticky compound problem"—where compounds adhere to plastic pipet tips, reducing apparent potency. Pharmacophore modeling using acoustic dispensing data produced binding models consistent with reality, while pipet-derived data missed important hydrophobic interactions. The paper emerged from AstraZeneca patents showing both dispensing methods, providing rare side-by-side comparison. This represents a potentially widespread but underreported issue in drug screening, as most previous evidence existed only in conference posters and internal discussions rather than peer-reviewed literature.

## 2. HISTORY

After this article's publication, the assay variability issue gained broader recognition in drug discovery. Major developments include:

**Validation and Expanded Studies**: Subsequent research confirmed and expanded on these findings. Studies demonstrated that adsorption issues affect not just plastic tips but various surfaces, particularly for lipophilic compounds. The phenomenon became recognized as a significant source of false negatives in high-throughput screening.

**Industry Response**: Pharmaceutical companies increasingly adopted acoustic dispensing technologies, especially for challenging compound classes. Labcyte (later acquired by Beckman Coulter in 2018) expanded its acoustic liquid handling systems, with broader industry adoption for critical assays. Quality control protocols began incorporating multiple dispensing methods for validation.

**Technological Solutions**: Alternative materials and surface treatments emerged to reduce compound adsorption. Low-binding plastics and specialized coatings became more common in liquid handling equipment. Some companies developed dedicated low-adsorption consumables for problematic compound classes.

**Regulatory Impact**: While not leading to specific FDA policy changes, the issue influenced best practices in assay validation for drug approval submissions. Greater emphasis was placed on demonstrating assay robustness and controlling for method-dependent artifacts in potency measurements.

**Scientific Community**: The PLOS ONE paper became highly cited (over 100 citations), spurring methodological improvements across academic and industrial screening. Discussion expanded to related issues like compound aggregation and colloidal formation affecting assay results.

**EphB4 Inhibitor Field**: The specific EphB4 inhibitor compounds mentioned did not reach FDA approval, but the target remained under investigation. The assay issues highlighted likely contributed to better characterization of compound series in later drug discovery efforts against this receptor tyrosine kinase.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Implicit prediction about widespread impact**: The article strongly suggested this dispensing artifact affected many historical datasets. **Outcome**: Confirmed. Numerous subsequent studies identified similar issues across different assay types and compound classes, leading to systematic re-evaluation of some historical screening data.

• **Prediction about limited data availability**: Article noted companies unlikely to release large compound datasets comparing methods due to confidentiality. **Outcome**: Partially accurate. While comprehensive datasets remained scarce, individual companies increasingly presented method comparison data at conferences and in quality-focused publications, contributing to collective understanding.

• **Prediction about methodological improvement**: Suggested this work would catalyze better awareness and validation practices. **Outcome**: Confirmed. The study became foundational in discussions about assay validation and contributed to increased adoption of acoustic dispensing and other low-adsorption methods for challenging compounds. Many screening facilities implemented cross-validation protocols.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article highlighted a critical but underappreciated technical problem with broad implications for drug discovery accuracy. It successfully brought attention to systematic artifacts affecting potency measurements, ultimately contributing to improved screening practices and instrumentation across the pharmaceutical industry.
