# Drug R&D Spending Now Down (But Look at the History) (June 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary noted that, for the first time since the modern era of pharmaceutical research began, global spending on drug discovery and development fell to roughly **$68 billion** in 2010 – a 3 % drop from the $70 billion spent in 2008‑2009.  The author linked the decline to “poor returns on R&D,” pointing to a long‑term slide in the ratio of new molecular entities (NMEs) approved per dollar invested.  A Boston Consulting Group chart was cited that showed a steady fall in “new drugs per $ billion R&D” over the previous two decades, which the writer interpreted as evidence of “low‑hanging fruit” being exhausted.  He also argued that the rise of generics and the lack of truly new disease targets (e.g., Alzheimer’s) further depressed productivity, while noting that past spikes (the 1990s HIV boom, the 2002 PDUFA re‑authorisation) were tied to novel disease challenges.  Finally, the piece speculated that breakthroughs such as genomics might reverse the trend, but expressed skepticism that they had yet done so.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Spending trends after 2011**  
- **2012‑2019:** Global pharma R&D outlays rebounded sharply, climbing from ~ $80 billion (2012) to **≈ $180‑$200 billion** by 2019 (IQVIA/PhRMA data).  The rise was driven by large‑molecule biologics, immuno‑oncology, and the entry of big‑tech and venture‑backed biotech firms.  
- **2020‑2022 (COVID‑19 pandemic):** R&D spending surged again, with an estimated **$210‑$220 billion** in 2021, as companies and governments poured money into vaccine platforms, antivirals, and rapid‑response infrastructure.  The spike was largely temporary; 2023‑2025 spending has settled back to the high‑$180 billion range.  

**Productivity and approvals**  
- **NMEs approved (US FDA):** The early‑2010s saw ~ 40‑45 NMEs per year, dropping to a low of **≈ 20‑25** in 2016‑2018.  A modest recovery began in 2019‑2022, with **≈ 30‑35** approvals annually, driven by oncology biologics, gene‑therapy products, and the two mRNA COVID‑19 vaccines (2020).  
- **Biologics & cell‑based therapies:** Since 2011, biologics now account for **> 50 %** of total R&D spend and > 60 % of new approvals.  CAR‑T (Kymriah 2017, Yescarta 2017) and several gene‑therapy products (e.g., **Zolgensma** 2019, **Luxturna** 2017) entered the market, validating the “genomics‑driven” optimism, albeit in niche indications.  

**Generics and market dynamics**  
- The generic share of US prescriptions rose from **≈ 80 %** in 2011 to **≈ 90 %** in 2024, compressing revenues for many small‑molecule blockbuster drugs and reinforcing the “low‑hanging fruit” narrative.  However, the overall size of the global pharmaceutical market continued to grow (≈ $1.5 trillion in 2024), largely because biologics and specialty medicines command higher prices.  

**Policy and regulatory shifts**  
- **PDUFA reauthorisations (2012, 2017, 2022)** introduced faster review timelines and fee structures that modestly improved launch speed but did not fundamentally alter the R&D cost curve.  
- The **21st Century Cures Act (2016)** and subsequent FDA “breakthrough therapy” designations expanded accelerated pathways, especially for oncology and rare‑disease products.  
- **US drug pricing reforms** (e.g., Inflation Reduction Act 2022) introduced price‑cap mechanisms for Medicare‑covered drugs, prompting some large firms to re‑evaluate investment in high‑cost specialty pipelines.  

**Industry structure**  
- Consolidation accelerated: the number of “big‑pharma” companies with > $10 billion annual revenue fell from **≈ 30** in 2011 to **≈ 20** in 2024, as mergers (e.g., Pfizer‑Wyeth, Bayer‑Stada) and divestitures reshaped the landscape.  
- Venture‑backed biotech firms proliferated; the number of US biotech IPOs rose from ~ 10 per year (pre‑2011) to **> 30 per year** in the 2020‑2024 window, reflecting a shift of early‑stage R&D risk away from the traditional majors.  

**Overall assessment**  
The 2011 warning about declining R&D efficiency proved prescient in the sense that **per‑dollar productivity has not returned to the “golden” 1990s levels**.  Spending has risen dramatically, but the number of first‑in‑class NMEs per dollar remains low, and many high‑cost launches target small patient populations.  The “genomics‑frenzy” did yield tangible products (gene‑therapy approvals, CRISPR‑based trials), but these represent a **tiny fraction of total market revenue** and have not reversed the macro‑trend of rising costs versus modest incremental approvals.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from article) | What actually happened | Evaluation |
|---------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Genomics would “turn things around” and revive R&D productivity** | Genomics enabled a handful of first‑in‑class gene‑therapy products (Luxturna 2017, Zolgensma 2019) and accelerated target identification, but these are niche and high‑cost. Overall NME‑per‑dollar productivity has not markedly improved. | Partially correct: scientific breakthroughs occurred, but macro‑productivity gains were limited. |
| **A new disease (e.g., HIV in the 1990s) is needed to spark a spending surge** | The COVID‑19 pandemic (a new disease) triggered an unprecedented, **temporary** surge in R&D spending and rapid vaccine approvals, but the spike receded after the emergency phase. | Accurate for the short‑term effect; long‑term spending returned to pre‑pandemic growth trajectory. |
| **Regulatory tightening would further depress R&D returns** | FDA’s accelerated programs (Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track) have **eased** some regulatory burdens for high‑need products, while safety‑related litigation and post‑marketing requirements have increased costs. Net effect: modestly higher development timelines for small‑molecule drugs, but faster pathways for biologics. | Mixed; regulatory tightening has not been the dominant driver of cost trends. |
| **Generics will keep “good drugs” cheap, contributing to the downward trend** | Generic market share continued to expand, driving down revenues for many legacy small‑molecule blockbusters. However, the rise of biologics (which cannot be fully genericized) offset some of this pressure. | Correct regarding generics, but the overall market grew due to biologics. |
| **R&D spending would continue to decline after 2010** | Spending **rebounded** from 2012 onward and reached historic highs by 2020. The 2011 dip was a brief blip, not the start of a long‑term decline. | Incorrect. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment when the industry first confronted a measurable decline in R&D spend, and its themes (low‑hanging fruit, the promise of genomics, the impact of new diseases) remain central to ongoing debates about pharmaceutical productivity.  Its prescient observations make it highly relevant, though some predictions proved only partially true.
