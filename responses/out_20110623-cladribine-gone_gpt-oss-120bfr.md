# Cladribine Is Gone (June 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary noted that the MS treatment landscape was being reshaped by the launch of Novartis’s oral drug fingolimod (Gilenya).  At the same time, Merck KGaA (the German Merck) was pursuing its own oral candidate, cladribine—a nucleoside analog already used for certain leukemias.  Early phase‑II data had shown promise for relapsing‑remitting MS, but the author reported that Merck KGaA was withdrawing its regulatory filings in the EU and the US and pulling the drug from the only markets where it had been approved (Russia and Australia).  The piece suggested that, with cladribine out of the picture, Novartis would face less competition and that Merck’s pipeline would suffer.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory turn‑around (2014‑2019).**  
- After the 2011 withdrawal, Merck KGaA re‑evaluated cladribine.  A new phase‑III program (CLARITY) was completed, showing a durable reduction in relapse rate and MRI activity in relapsing‑MS patients, albeit with notable lymphopenia.  
- The European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted a positive opinion in 2017, and the drug was approved in the EU in 2017 under the brand name **Mavenclad** for relapsing‑remitting MS (RRMS) and active secondary‑progressive MS (SPMS).  
- The U.S. FDA initially rejected the 2017 filing, citing safety concerns (especially infection risk and a possible malignancy signal).  Merck submitted additional data and a risk‑evaluation‑and‑mitigation‑strategy (REMS).  In **March 2019**, the FDA approved Mavenclad for RRMS and active SPMS, making it the first oral cladribine product in the United States.

**Clinical uptake and safety profile.**  
- Post‑approval, Mavenclad has been incorporated into treatment algorithms as an “induction‑type” oral therapy, typically given as two short courses a year apart.  Real‑world data (2020‑2023) confirm efficacy comparable to other high‑efficacy DMTs, but the drug’s use is limited by the need for careful lymphocyte monitoring and the REMS program.  
- Safety signals observed in trials (grade 3–4 lymphopenia, opportunistic infections, and a modest increase in malignancy incidence) have led to contraindications in patients with a history of cancer and to strict monitoring requirements.  No major post‑marketing safety crises have emerged, but the drug remains less widely prescribed than fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, or ocrelizumab.

**Impact on the competitive landscape.**  
- Novartis continued to market Gilenya and later launched **Zeposia** (ozanimod) in 2020, adding another oral S1P‑modulator.  
- The re‑emergence of cladribine gave clinicians an additional high‑efficacy oral option, but it did not dramatically shift market share away from existing products.  
- Merck KGaA’s overall biotech portfolio benefited from Mavenclad’s sales (≈ €300 M in 2022), helping offset earlier pipeline disappointments.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** *Merck KGaA would abandon cladribine, withdrawing all applications and removing the drug from the market.*  
  **Outcome:** False.  After a pause, Merck re‑started development, secured EMA approval in 2017, and FDA approval in 2019.  

- **Prediction:** *The withdrawal would leave the field “open for Novartis,” giving it a competitive advantage.*  
  **Outcome:** Partially true in the short term (2011‑2014) when Novartis faced less oral competition, but the later approval of Mavenclad (and other oral agents) restored competition.  

- **Prediction:** *German Merck would be “in some trouble” because of the cladribine setback.*  
  **Outcome:** Not borne out.  While Merck KGaA experienced other pipeline setbacks, Mavenclad’s eventual approval provided a successful product and contributed positively to its revenue.  

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment of uncertainty that later proved temporary; the eventual reversal of cladribine’s fate makes the piece a useful case study in drug‑development risk and regulatory dynamics.
