# A Quick Glassware Question (December 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article is a brief inquiry from a researcher seeking to purchase Corex glass tubes (approximately 3cm × 28cm) for laboratory use. The author notes that Corex is an aluminosilicate glass made by Corning that is mechanically strong and commonly used in centrifuge tubes, but expresses frustration that plain tubes of the material seem unavailable through typical suppliers.

## 2. HISTORY
Following this 2010 post, Corex glass has remained a specialized laboratory material primarily manufactured by Corning. The market for Corex tubes did not expand significantly or become widely available through general lab suppliers. Corning continued to produce Corex centrifuge tubes and related products, but plain tubes of the dimensions sought (3cm × 28cm) remained difficult to source outside specialized distributors. The material maintained its niche application in high-strength centrifuge applications where its mechanical properties are advantageous, but it never became a standard general-purpose laboratory glassware. Corning's product line continues to focus on the centrifuge tube format rather than plain tubing for general use.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
There were no predictions made in this article. The post was purely an informational inquiry about purchasing glassware, not a forward-looking analysis or commentary on future trends.

## 4. INTEREST
Interest Score: **2**

This was a routine technical inquiry about specialized laboratory equipment procurement, not a substantive commentary on biotechnology trends or developments. While useful for researchers seeking similar materials, it lacks broader scientific, commercial, or policy implications that would warrant higher interest ranking.
