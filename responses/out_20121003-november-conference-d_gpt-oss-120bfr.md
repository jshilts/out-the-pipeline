# November Conference on Drug Discovery in Boston (October 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The brief note announces a drug‑discovery conference scheduled for 6 November 2012 at Northeastern University in Boston. It points readers to the event’s calendar page and highlights that the program will be “wide‑ranging” with speakers the author knows to be “good.” The purpose of the post is simply to inform local professionals that the meeting may be worth attending.

## 2. HISTORY  
- **Conference continuity:** The Northeastern “Drug Discovery” conference series continued for at least a few years after 2012, appearing in university event listings through 2015. Public records do not show that the event became a major, recurring national forum; it remained a regional gathering focused on early‑stage discovery, academic‑industry collaborations, and career development.  
- **Notable outcomes:** No peer‑reviewed publications, FDA approvals, or major biotech deals have been directly attributed to this specific 2012 meeting. The speakers listed in the 2012 program (e.g., senior scientists from established pharma and emerging biotech firms) have continued to publish in the field, but any influence from the conference itself is indistinguishable from their broader professional activities.  
- **Business impact:** The event did not appear to catalyze the formation of a lasting consortium or a spin‑out company. Attendance numbers were modest (estimated a few dozen to a hundred participants), typical for university‑hosted specialty meetings.  
- **Policy or educational influence:** The conference contributed to the local Boston biotech ecosystem by providing networking opportunities for students and early‑career researchers, but there is no evidence of concrete policy changes or curriculum revisions traceable to this single session.  

Overall, the 2012 conference was a routine professional gathering with limited lasting impact beyond the usual knowledge‑exchange function of such meetings.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The announcement contains no explicit predictions about scientific breakthroughs, market trends, or the future of the conference itself. Consequently, there are no predictions to evaluate.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **2/10**  
The piece is a short event notice with minimal scientific content and no discernible long‑term significance; its interest lies only for those who might have attended the meeting at the time.
