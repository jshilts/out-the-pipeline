# Cutting Back On Lousy Conferences (November 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the problem of low-quality scientific conferences that function primarily as "presentation mills" for CV padding or vacation opportunities funded by institutions. The author notes that South Korea's Education Ministry was implementing vetting procedures to ensure overseas conference travel has genuine academic value. The piece distinguishes between legitimate conferences (like Gordon and Keystone meetings) held in various venues and predatory "junket" conferences characterized by gaudy titles, overly broad focus areas, excessive marketing language, affiliation with questionable publishers, and poor English quality. The author argues that such conferences waste valuable time and resources, and welcomes Korea's regulatory approach.

## 2. HISTORY

After the article's publication, several developments occurred in scientific conference practices and policies:

**Implementation of Stricter Oversight**: Many universities and research institutions globally began implementing more rigorous approval processes for conference attendance, particularly for international travel. This included heightened scrutiny of conference legitimacy and academic value, following similar principles to South Korea's approach.

**COVID-19 Pandemic Impact**: The 2020-2023 pandemic dramatically transformed conference culture, forcing widespread adoption of virtual and hybrid formats. This reduced travel-related costs and eliminated many "junket" opportunities, while simultaneously making conference quality more transparent. The financial barriers to attending legitimate conferences decreased significantly.

**Rise of Virtual Conference Platforms**: Post-2020 saw accelerated development of sophisticated virtual conferencing technologies, allowing broader access to high-quality scientific meetings without travel expenses. This democratized access to reputable conferences while undermining the business model of predatory conference organizers who relied on location-based appeal.

**Increased Institutional Awareness**: Research funding agencies and academic institutions became more systematic in evaluating conference quality before approving travel funding or considering conference presentations in tenure decisions.

**Predatory Conference Adaptation**: Some predatory conference organizers adapted by creating virtual events or rebranding, though their effectiveness in attracting legitimate researchers diminished as institutional awareness grew.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions about addressing conference quality issues:

• **South Korea's policy effectiveness**: The article implied that Korea's approach might inspire others to follow. **Outcome**: While not directly adopted as policy elsewhere, the principles influenced institutional decision-making globally. Many research institutions implemented similar vetting processes without formal government mandates.

• **Continuing problem of predatory conferences**: The article predicted that without systemic changes, low-quality conferences would continue exploiting researchers. **Outcome**: The pandemic temporarily disrupted this model, and increased institutional awareness reduced the effectiveness of such conferences for legitimate career advancement. However, some predatory organizers persist, adapting to virtual formats.

• **Reputation-based conference evaluation**: The article predicted that reputable conferences would remain valuable. **Outcome**: This proved accurate - established conference series maintained their status, and the pandemic-era shift to virtual formats actually strengthened the position of well-regarded meetings by reducing travel barriers.

• **Wastefulness of low-quality conferences**: The prediction that time and resources would continue being wasted. **Outcome**: The shift toward more selective conference attendance and virtual participation significantly reduced this waste, as researchers became more selective and institutions more discriminating in funding decisions.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

While the topic addresses real issues in academic culture, this falls in the lower half of interest for a science/business biotechnology publication, as it focuses more on academic administrative issues rather than scientific or commercial developments in biotechnology itself.
