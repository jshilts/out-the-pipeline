# Retrospective Analysis: "Publish On Sight"

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief blog post from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" column is a sardonic critique of academic publishing trends circa 2014. Lowe mock-celebrates a paper combining what he considers "editor-bait" topics: ionic liquids on carbon nanotubes, complete with a glowing fluorescent BODIPY-tagged sample in the graphical abstract. The title "Publish On Sight" sarcastically suggests that such trendy combinations practically guarantee publication regardless of scientific substance.

The piece captures Lowe's characteristic skepticism toward research that prioritizes "hot" buzzword combinations over genuine scientific novelty. By singling out ionic liquids, carbon nanotubes, and BODIPY fluorophores as particularly fashionable ingredients, he implies that editors and reviewers might be swayed more by fashionable topic clusters than by actual scientific merit.

## 2. HISTORY

**What Actually Happened to These Technologies:**

**Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs):** Post-2014 saw continued CNT research but with diminished hype. While CNTs found niche applications (conductive polymers, some electronics, composite materials), they never achieved the revolutionary "wonder material" status predicted in the 2000s. Production challenges, toxicity concerns, and competition from graphene and other 2D materials slowed widespread adoption. The field matured into more realistic, specialized applications rather than the transformative technology once envisioned.

**Ionic Liquids:** These maintained steady academic interest but remained largely confined to specialized industrial processes (electrolytes, catalysis, separations). Their promise as "green solvents" was tempered by high costs, purification challenges, and the realization that not all ionic liquids are actually environmentally benign. Research shifted toward more targeted, practical applications rather than broad revolutionary claims.

**BODIPY Fluorophores:** These became workhorse dyes in biological imaging and diagnostics due to their excellent photostability and tunable properties. However, they remained one of multiple dye families (alongside fluorescein, rhodamine, cyanines, etc.) rather than displacing all alternatives. The field matured into sophisticated molecular design rather than hype-driven claims.

The broader trend Lowe identified—papers built on fashionable topic combinations—continued throughout the 2010s with different "hot" combinations: machine learning + materials science, CRISPR + everything, COVID-19 + any field (2020-2023).

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**What Lowe Got Right:**

- **His core thesis was prescient:** Trendy topic combinations continued to dominate certain publication venues, often prioritizing novelty appeal over scientific depth.
- **The cyclical nature of scientific fashion:** The specific "hot" topics changed (CNTs declined, others rose), but the phenomenon of editorial preference for fashionable combinations persisted.
- **The importance of graphical abstracts:** These became even more crucial in scientific publishing, with visually appealing abstracts sometimes outweighing content quality in initial review.

**What the Article Underestimated:**

- **The staying power of incremental research:** While Lowe implied these combinations lacked substance, many such papers contributed to genuine scientific progress through steady accumulation rather than revolutionary breakthroughs.
- **Industrial adoption realities:** The technologies Lowe mentioned did find real-world applications, just not at the revolutionary scale initially hyped—a more nuanced outcome than his dismissal suggested.
- **The evolution of scientific publishing:** While fashion-driven publication continued, metrics and evaluation systems became more sophisticated post-2014, somewhat mitigating (though not eliminating) pure trend-chasing.

**What He Didn't Predict:**

- The rise of entirely new "hot" combinations (AI/ML applications across all fields)
- How peer review would evolve with preprints and post-publication review
- That some fashionable combinations would lead to productive research communities beyond mere trend-following

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 5/10**

This is a solid mid-tier article: professionally interesting but not historically significant. 

**Why it doesn't rank higher (6-9):** It's a brief blog post making a narrow point about a specific moment in publishing culture. It didn't predict major technological shifts or influence policy. The technologies discussed were already established research areas by 2014.

**Why it doesn't rank lower (0-4):** The piece captures something timeless about scientific publishing: the tension between genuine innovation and trend-chasing for publication. The specific technologies Lowe mentions provide a fascinating snapshot of what was fashionable in 2014, and his cynical assessment has aged well—the phenomenon he identified continues today with different buzzword combinations. The retrospective value lies in understanding how scientific publishing fashions evolve, and how even skeptical contemporary observers can miss the nuances of how technologies actually mature (slowly, with real but less glamorous applications).

The article serves as a useful historical marker of mid-2010s research culture, but its impact and forward-looking value remain limited to understanding publishing dynamics rather than technological or scientific advancement itself.
