# Liquid Handling (October 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The brief commentary, posted on 27 Oct 2011, mentions that the author was contacted by a Bay‑Area inventor (contact: carlcrott‑at‑gmail‑dot‑com) who had built a prototype of a “high‑throughput, low‑footprint liquid‑handler” device. The author had not seen the instrument in operation and did not know the inventor personally, but offered the contact information to readers who might be interested in acquiring such equipment. No technical details, performance data, or business context were provided.

## 2. HISTORY  
- **Market evolution** – Over the decade after 2011 the laboratory‑automation market did see a surge in compact, high‑throughput liquid‑handling platforms. Companies such as **Opentrons (founded 2015)**, **Tecan (with the Fluent 8 and Freedom EVO series)**, and **Hamilton (Microlab STARlet)** released instruments that emphasized a small footprint and scalable throughput.  
- **No trace of the specific prototype** – A search of patents, product announcements, and press releases from 2011‑2025 yields no record of a commercial product directly linked to “carlcrott” or the email address given. The prototype appears not to have progressed to a marketable system, at least not under a recognizable brand.  
- **Adoption of low‑footprint devices** – The broader trend toward “bench‑top” or “desktop” liquid handlers has been driven by academic labs and biotech startups seeking automation without the space and cost of traditional robotic workstations. These devices are now commonplace, but their adoption is attributed to the companies listed above rather than the unnamed 2011 prototype.  
- **Business impact** – No company founded around that prototype is listed among the major automation players, and there are no FDA‑approved diagnostics or therapeutics that cite the device as a critical enabling technology. Consequently, the prototype did not generate a measurable commercial or scientific impact.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The original note did not contain explicit predictions, but it implied two expectations:

- **Prediction:** *There is a market need for a compact, high‑throughput liquid handler, and interested parties will seek it out.*  
  **Outcome:** The market need proved real; however, the demand was satisfied by other manufacturers (Opentrons, Tecan, Hamilton, etc.). The specific prototype did not become a notable product.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *The inventor could find customers quickly, given the “break” in the business environment.*  
  **Outcome:** No evidence of sales, licensing, or partnership deals involving the prototype has surfaced. The inventor’s outreach appears to have had little to no traction.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **2/10**  
The piece is a short, unsubstantiated advertisement with no lasting scientific or commercial relevance; its only interest lies as a historical footnote to the broader trend toward compact liquid‑handling automation.
