# Depressing Figures for Acomplia (November 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses safety concerns surrounding Sanofi-Aventis's anti-obesity drug Acomplia (rimonabant), which targets the endocannabinoid system through a novel CNS mechanism. The drug had faced significant FDA delays due to psychiatric side effects including suicidal ideation. A new meta-analysis published in The Lancet revealed that patients taking the drug in Europe showed a 2.5 times higher risk of dropping out of trials due to depression compared to placebo groups, despite depressed patients being excluded from the original studies. The analysis covered 2,503 patients on the drug versus 1,602 on placebo, with depression occurring in 74 versus 22 cases respectively. The author compares this to the Avandia controversy, noting that while depression is less immediately serious than heart attacks, it represents a significant safety concern that should make Sanofi-Aventis relieved the drug wasn't approved in the US market.

## 2. HISTORY

Acomplia's trajectory after this 2007 article was decidedly negative. In October 2008, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended suspension of Acomplia's marketing authorization across Europe due to the psychiatric side effects discussed in the article. The drug was subsequently withdrawn from the European market. The FDA never approved rimonabant for use in the United States.

This marked a significant setback for cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) antagonists as a therapeutic class for obesity and metabolic disorders. The mechanism, once considered promising due to its effects on appetite and metabolism, was largely abandoned due to the unacceptable psychiatric side effect profile that emerged across multiple clinical trials.

Several other pharmaceutical companies developing similar CB1 antagonists either discontinued their programs or never brought them to market. The rimonabant case became a textbook example in drug development of how CNS-targeting drugs can reveal unexpected psychiatric adverse events that outweigh their therapeutic benefits. Many patients who had been prescribed the drug in Europe were transitioned to other obesity treatments.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained an implicit prediction that Acomplia would likely face continued regulatory challenges and potential legal liability. This prediction proved accurate in several ways:

• **Regulatory outcome**: The prediction that the FDA delays reflected serious safety concerns was confirmed when the drug was never approved in the US and subsequently withdrawn from European markets due to psychiatric side effects.

• **Legal exposure**: The suggestion that Sanofi-Aventis might face significant legal liability proved prescient, as the company faced numerous lawsuits and substantial costs related to the drug's withdrawal and associated adverse events.

• **Mechanism concerns**: The broader concern about novel CNS mechanisms turned out to be well-founded, as the entire class of CB1 antagonists for obesity was essentially abandoned due to the psychiatric safety signal first identified with rimonabant.

The article's cynical take—that FDA rejection might have actually benefited Sanofi-Aventis by limiting liability exposure—appears to have been accurate given the drug's ultimate failure.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates prescient analysis of drug safety signals and their real-world implications, making it a valuable case study in pharmaceutical risk assessment. The author's CNS expertise and cautious approach to novel mechanisms provided genuinely useful insight into Acomplia's eventual failure.
