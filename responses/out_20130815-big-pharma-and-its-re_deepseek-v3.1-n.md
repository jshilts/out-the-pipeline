# Big Pharma And Its Research Publications (August 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a bibliometric study analyzing publication patterns of 15 major pharmaceutical companies from 1995 to 2009. Researchers found that Big Pharma publications in the top 350 journals declined by about 9% over this period, accounting for roughly 4% of total journal content (approximately 10,000 papers annually). The decline appeared partly attributable to mergers and acquisitions, where newly formed companies published fewer papers than their predecessor firms combined.

Key findings included an increase in multi-author collaborations (growing faster than the journal baseline), with European research sites showing decline particularly in the UK, Switzerland, and France, while Germany maintained better performance and US-based labs demonstrated strong influence. The authors interpreted these trends as evidence of Big Pharma shifting from "Open Science" (public knowledge sharing through publications) toward "Open Innovation" (selective knowledge sharing with specific collaboration partners).

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication in 2013, pharmaceutical publication and R&D collaboration trends largely continued and accelerated in the directions identified:

**Industry Consolidation and Research Site Closures**: Major companies continued consolidating research facilities throughout the 2010s. Notable examples include Pfizer's restructuring, AstraZeneca's site rationalization, and Novartis's ongoing reorganizations. These moves reduced internal research footprints and publication output from traditional company labs.

**Open Innovation Models**: The shift toward externalized R&D intensified, with companies increasingly relying on academic partnerships, biotech collaborations, and venture investments rather than purely internal drug discovery. Initiatives like Pfizer's Centers for Therapeutic Innovation, AZ's open innovation platforms, and J&J's innovation centers exemplified this trend of collaborative rather than proprietary research.

**US Research Dominance**: The geographic concentration in biomedical research continued strengthening in the US, particularly around major hubs like Boston/Cambridge, San Francisco, and San Diego. European research presence declined further as companies redirected investment toward US-based collaborations and acquisitions.

**Publication Culture Changes**: Academic and industry partnerships increasingly governed by intellectual property agreements that restricted traditional publication timelines and content, reducing the volume of freely shared research findings compared to historical norms.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article and underlying study made several implicit and explicit predictions:

• **Shift from Open Science to Open Innovation would continue**: **Accurate**. The 2010s saw sustained movement toward selective partnership-based knowledge sharing over broad public dissemination through publications.

• **R&D externalization and system integration focus**: **Accurate**. Major companies increasingly became drug development and commercialization engines rather than discovery organizations, relying on biotech and academic partnerships for innovation while focusing internally on clinical development and regulatory affairs.

• **US dominance in pharmaceutical research**: **Accurate**. The geographic concentration continued, with US-based research collaborations and hubs maintaining superior access to funding, talent, and innovation ecosystems compared to European counterparts.

• **Merger-driven publication decline**: **Accurate**. Consolidation wave continued (e.g., Pfizer-Wyeth, AZ-MedImmune expansions, numerous smaller acquisitions), with unified companies publishing less than component firms historically did separately.

• **European research decline**: **Mostly accurate**, though Germany maintained stronger research presence than UK, Switzerland, and France as predicted.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

While focused on bibliometrics rather than direct biomedical innovation, the article accurately identified fundamental shifts in pharmaceutical R&D strategy that defined the subsequent decade, making it substantively prescient about industry transformation from internal discovery to external innovation integration.
