# You Should Take Chemistry: A Response (Oct 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a rebuttal to a earlier Washington Post guest‑blog that argued against forcing high‑school students to take chemistry.  S. Raj Govindarajan contends that, while students should not be compelled to become scientists, a **mandatory chemistry course** is still essential.  He argues that the current curriculum is outdated and should be redesigned to emphasize **practical knowledge, curiosity, and an appreciation of scientific achievement**.  The underlying goal is to produce a citizenry that can understand and support scientific research, thereby reducing the risk of politically driven cuts to science funding.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Curriculum reform** – In the years following 2012, the United States moved toward the *Next Generation Science Standards* (NGSS), first released in 2013 and adopted by many states by 2015. NGSS explicitly calls for **integrated chemistry concepts**, inquiry‑based labs, and real‑world relevance—exactly the kind of “rethinking” Govindarajan advocated. While adoption has been uneven, the overall trend has been toward more **application‑focused chemistry instruction** in high schools.

**Funding and policy** – Federal support for K‑12 STEM education (e.g., the *Every Student Succeeds Act* of 2015) remained steady, and the *America COMPETES Act* was reauthorized in 2018, preserving research and education budgets. There has been no major legislative effort to *cut* basic science funding on the basis of public opposition, suggesting that the feared scenario has not materialized.

**Public scientific literacy** – Surveys (e.g., Pew Research Center, 2014‑2022) show modest gains in public understanding of basic scientific concepts, but also persistent gaps, especially around climate change and vaccines. The broader cultural debate about science education has intensified (e.g., “critical race theory” controversies in 2021‑2022), but chemistry itself has not become a flashpoint.

**Industry impact** – The biotech and pharmaceutical sectors have continued to rely on a pipeline of graduates with solid chemistry foundations. Enrollment in undergraduate chemistry programs has remained relatively stable (≈ 5 % of STEM majors), and the demand for chemists in drug discovery, materials science, and green chemistry has grown, driven by advances in **CRISPR**, **mRNA therapeutics**, and **sustainable manufacturing**.

Overall, the article’s call for a more purposeful chemistry curriculum aligns with the direction taken by national standards and state reforms, though the piece itself did not trigger any identifiable policy change.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article does not lay out explicit, time‑bound predictions, but it implies two expectations:

- **Prediction 1:** *Curricula will be rethought to deliver practical, curiosity‑driven chemistry education.*  
  **Outcome:** Largely realized through NGSS and subsequent state adoptions, which emphasize real‑world applications and inquiry. The shift is ongoing; many districts still struggle with resources, but the trend matches the prediction.

- **Prediction 2:** *A scientifically literate public will be less likely to vote for cuts to research funding.*  
  **Outcome:** Partially true. While there have been no major, voter‑driven cuts to federal research budgets, public support for science remains mixed, and politicization of topics like climate change persists. The prediction overstates the protective effect of a single high‑school chemistry course.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The article is a modestly interesting snapshot of the 2012 debate over science education; it reflects enduring concerns but did not itself drive major change, placing it in the middle of the relevance spectrum.
