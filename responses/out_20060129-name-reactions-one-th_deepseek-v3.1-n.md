# Name Reactions for One Thousand, Alex (January 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2006 commentary critiques a then-common chemistry interview practice: the "blackboard interview," where candidates were asked to rapidly write down chemical reactions and their mechanisms under pressure. The author argues the exercise was a poor proxy for actual research aptitude, comparing it to "a PhD defense" and recalling its prevalence at companies like Syntex in the 1980s. He posits that the rise of searchable databases like SciFinder undermines the rationale for memorizing countless transformations; instead, the critical skill has shifted to evaluating multiple possible routes and choosing the most plausible. He proposes a more modern interview format: give candidates six ways to do a reaction and ask them to recommend which one to try first and why.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following 2006, these critiques gained substantial traction across scientific and tech hiring:
- **Interview Reform**: The blackboard-style memory test largely fell out of favor in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Companies like Google and other tech leaders led broader shifts away from brain-teasers and memorization-based questions toward work-sample tests (e.g., realistic problem-solving or coding challenges), structured behavioral interviews, and portfolio-based evaluation.
- **Practical Skills Emphasis**: For chemistry roles, interviews evolved toward assessing practical judgment: candidates might be asked to design synthetic routes, troubleshoot failed experiments, optimize reaction conditions, or interpret data from literature. This aligns with the author's suggestion to focus on "which one would you try first and why."
- **On-the-Job Realities**: The prediction about SciFinder and digital databases became the norm. Researchers now rely on tools like SciFinder, Reaxys, and PubChem to quickly identify known reactions and look up conditions.
- **No Memorable "Drug" Outcomes**: The article did not center on a specific drug or platform, so there are no drug-approval outcomes to report.
- **Policy and Industry Impact**: While not a formal policy shift, hiring practices in biotech/pharma moved away from high-pressure memorization. The author's proposed alternative—comparing plausible synthetic routes—became standard practice in both interviews and actual lab work.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Prediction**: Traditional "name the reaction" blackboard interviews will become obsolete, supplanted by questions that evaluate judgment and problem-solving with modern tools.
  - **Outcome**: This largely came true. Most chemistry and biotech hiring moved away from memory challenges and toward realistic problem-solving, data interpretation, and practical experimental design. The shift mirrors broader trends away from high-pressure academic-style questioning toward work-related skills.
- **Implicit Prediction**: Expertise in sorting multiple plausible options will become more important than recalling a vast catalog of reactions.
  - **Outcome**: Confirmed. Tools like SciFinder, Reaxys, and reaction-prediction software make it easy to find routes; the key skill is choosing the best pathway under constraints (cost, yield, safety, scalability), which aligns with how industrial chemists work.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**

This article addressed a niche hiring practice and was prescient about its decline, but it did not explore more transformative scientific or regulatory changes. Its scope and long-term importance are modest compared to breakthrough science or major policy shifts, though it remains a useful historical marker of evolving hiring norms in chemistry and biotech.
