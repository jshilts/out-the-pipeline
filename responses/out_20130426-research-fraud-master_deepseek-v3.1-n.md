# Research Fraud, From A Master Fraud Artist (April 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses the extensive research fraud committed by Diederik Stapel, a Dutch social psychologist who fabricated data for numerous studies over many years. The piece highlights specific examples of his deception, including an experiment where Stapel asked undergraduates to rate their attractiveness after being shown images of attractive or unattractive faces—when the real experiment didn't produce his desired results, he simply invented the data set and had it published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in 2004. The article emphasizes that Stapel's fraud was enabled by what investigating committees called "a general culture of careless, selective and uncritical handling of research and data" within the psychology field. The author notes that while few would go to Stapel's extremes, many common research practices—such as selective reporting of positive results, ignoring contradictory data, and giving shaky favorable data the benefit of the doubt—differ from outright fraud more in degree than in kind.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the exposure of Stapel's fraud, several concrete developments occurred. An investigative committee in the Netherlands thoroughly examined his work and identified **54** fraudulent publications that needed to be retracted. Major institutional changes were implemented: Tilburg University, where Stapel had been dean, overhauled its research integrity policies and procedures. This case became a watershed moment that catalyzed significant reforms in research oversight and publication practices within psychology and beyond. Many journals began implementing more rigorous data verification requirements, and the field saw increased emphasis on research replication studies. Several other high-profile fraud cases came to light in subsequent years (such as the Reproducibility Project in 2015), challenging the credibility of social psychology research and leading to what became known as the "replication crisis." While no specific drug approvals or clinical interventions were directly implicated (Stapel's work was in social psychology, not medical research), the case had lasting impact on research methodology standards and scientific publishing practices across multiple disciplines.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not contain explicit predictions about future events or developments. However, it did identify ongoing problems within research culture that would continue to manifest. While not framed as predictions, the concerns raised about research practices proved prescient—issues like questionable research practices, selective reporting, and insufficient critical review of submitted manuscripts continued to plague the field, as evidenced by the broader replication crisis that gained widespread attention in subsequent years.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article addresses an important case of scientific misconduct, but focuses more on individual fraud rather than the systemic issues affecting biotech research directly. It has moderate importance for illustrating research integrity challenges that span all scientific fields.
