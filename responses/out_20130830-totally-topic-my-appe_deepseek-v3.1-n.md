# Totally Off Topic: My Appearance on Jeopardy! (August 30, 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a personal narrative recounting the author's experience as a Jeopardy! contestant in 1995-1996. The story begins with the author traveling to Atlantic City to take the initial screening test for the game show, where he encountered another aspiring contestant who was frantically studying trivia books. The author passed both the preliminary and more challenging secondary tests, eventually receiving a call to appear on the show in Los Angeles.

The article describes the technical aspects of competing: contestants must wait for Alex Trebek to finish reading clues before buzzing in, timing is crucial, and the game moves very quickly. The author recounts a memorable moment during a Daily Double question about Lake Nasser being on the border between Egypt and Sudan, which he answered correctly after a moment of hesitation. Despite a close game where all three contestants correctly answered the Final Jeopardy question about Lady Chatterly's Lover, the author finished in second place by $200 ($13,100 to $13,300). He declined the furniture prizes due to tax implications and style preferences, instead receiving various small items like Miracle-Gro and cough drops.

## 2. HISTORY

This article is explicitly labeled as "totally off topic" and has no connection to the biotechnology industry. The personal anecdote about a 1995-1996 Jeopardy! appearance bears no relationship to scientific developments, drug approvals, clinical trials, or biotech business growth. The article makes no claims or observations relevant to biotechnology that could be analyzed with hindsight. There are no biotech companies mentioned, no scientific methods discussed, no policy implications to evaluate, and no therapeutic developments to track.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contains no predictions about biotechnology, medicine, or scientific developments. It is entirely retrospective, recounting a personal experience from nearly two decades prior to publication. The author makes no forward-looking statements about industry trends, technological advances, or medical breakthroughs. The article was clearly intended as light personal content for a holiday weekend, explicitly disconnected from the author's usual professional topics.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **0/10**

This article rates a score of 0 because it is explicitly "totally off-topic" and contains no information, analysis, or commentary relevant to the biotechnology industry. While it may be an entertaining personal story to the author's regular audience, it has no place in an analysis of biotechnology industry commentary and provides no value for evaluating developments in the field.
