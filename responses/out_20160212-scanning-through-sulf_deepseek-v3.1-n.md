# Scanning Through Sulfonyl Fluorides (February 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the Sharpless group at Scripps developing "sulfur-fluoride exchange" (SuFEx) reactions as an addition to click chemistry. These reactions enable researchers to link molecules using derivatives of commercial chemicals previously considered inert. The technique was being leveraged to hunt for new covalent bioactive compounds through intensive screening of unexplored chemical space. The work built on known activity of simple sulfonyl fluorides as protease inhibitors and expanded efforts to broadly examine their chemical-proteomic activity. The goal was creating diverse libraries of potential "covalent drugs" in the class of therapeutics that includes penicillin and aspirin, with screening planned in zebrafish models to identify therapeutic potential.

## 2. HISTORY

SuFEx chemistry continued development following this 2016 announcement, culminating in K. Barry Sharpless receiving his second Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2022 (shared with Carolyn Bertozzi and Morten Meldal) specifically for click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry developments. SuFEx reactions became established as valuable tools for drug discovery and materials science. The field of covalent drugs expanded significantly, with several FDA-approved covalent inhibitors reaching the market, including irreversible kinase inhibitors like osimertinib (Tagrisso) for lung cancer and BTK inhibitors like ibrutinib for blood cancers. However, the specific sulfonyl fluoride compounds discussed in this article have not led to major FDA-approved drugs that achieved widespread patient uptake, though they remain research tools and probes in chemical biology. Academic and industrial groups continue using SuFEx chemistry for library synthesis and screening, but it has not revolutionized drug discovery in the dramatic way initially hoped. The approach represents a useful technique rather than a transformative breakthrough that fundamentally changed pharmaceutical development pipelines.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: SuFEx chemistry would "uncover some pretty interesting stuff" in drug discovery through "intensive screening" of unexplored chemical space.
  **Reality**: The chemistry proved valuable for library synthesis, but did not yield breakthrough drugs that dramatically impacted patient care or entered widespread clinical use.

• **Prediction**: The technique would create diverse libraries of potential covalent drugs with therapeutic potential identifiable through zebrafish screening.
  **Reality**: Academic labs and some companies adopted SuFEx chemistry for chemical biology applications, but it did not become a dominant paradigm for drug discovery or lead to major approved therapeutics.

• **Prediction**: Having "new ways to get into big diverse libraries of such compounds could uncover some pretty interesting stuff."
  **Reality**: The chemistry enabled academic synthesis efforts and chemical proteomics studies, but pharmaceutical companies continued relying more heavily on traditional medicinal chemistry approaches rather than wholesale adoption of SuFEx libraries.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article describes an important chemical methodology that achieved formal recognition through a Nobel Prize, making it historically significant, though the practical therapeutic impact has been more modest than initially hoped.
