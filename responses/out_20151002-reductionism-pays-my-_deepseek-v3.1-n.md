# Reductionism Pays My Mortgage (October 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This personal reflection argues that reductionism—understanding systems by breaking them down into component parts—remains the most productive approach in science and drug discovery. The author illustrates this through sensory biology: vision reduces from eyeballs to rods/cones, then photochemical isomerization of double bonds; hearing and touch reduce to mechanically sensitive ion channels; temperature sensation reduces to specific "hot" and "cold" receptors (TRP channels) with compounds like menthol and capsaicin activating them. The essay then pivots to drug development, framing it as an applied reductionist pipeline from person → organ system → cells → biochemical pathways → proteins → small molecules that works "well enough" to sustain both careers and patients.

## 2. HISTORY
The core thesis—that reductionist drug discovery pays the bills—held up, but with important qualifications and some cautionary developments between 2015 and the present:

- Drug discovery outcomes remained mixed through the late 2010s, with high failure rates persisting. Conventional small-molecule reductionism continued producing drugs (cancer therapies, immunomodulators, metabolic drugs), but productivity plateaued and costs stayed high, supporting the author's pragmatic "well enough" framing rather than exuberant success.

- Mechanistic depth expanded rapidly on the very pathways he cited. TRP channels (the "hot/cold" sensors) became major drug targets: multiple TRPV1 antagonists reached clinical trials for pain, though many failed due to hyperthermia side effects or lack of efficacy; TRPM8 antagonists were pursued for migraine and overactive bladder; and TRPA1 emerged as a target in airway disease and itch. However, this deepened reductionism produced limited clinical wins—many programs were terminated, and approved drugs remained rare, suggesting that understanding molecular mechanisms did not guarantee drug viability.

- The ion-channel and sensory biology fields he referenced matured significantly. In 2021, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine went to David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian for their discoveries of temperature and touch receptors—TRPV1, TRPM8, and Piezo channels. This validated the fundamental science the author highlighted, but it did not translate into a wave of approved drugs targeting those mechanisms. The "molecular-level mechanisms" became clearer, but the path to medicines remained narrow.

- Industrial drug discovery shifted toward biologics and targeted therapies (antibodies, cell therapies, gene therapies) in ways that didn't invalidate reductionism but changed its expression. Reductionist antibody design—mapping epitopes, engineering Fc regions, optimizing binding kinetics—drove much of the growth in immunology and oncology, while small-molecule reductionism faced continued challenges in complex diseases (Alzheimer's, psychiatric disorders, and many pain conditions). The author's mortgage-paying formula still applied, but the "small molecule ligands" part became one tool among others.

- By the 2020s, artificial intelligence and machine learning were increasingly used to augment or accelerate reductionist workflows (predicting protein structures, screening virtual libraries, designing lead compounds), but they did not replace the underlying paradigm. The premise that knowing "what those parts are" remains indispensable stayed intact.

- Public and commercial confidence in the pharmaceutical industry remained stable to positive through the COVID-19 pandemic (with rapid mRNA vaccine and antiviral development partly grounded in reductionist virology and immunology), but public frustration with high prices, access, and mixed R&D productivity persisted, consistent with the author's tempered conclusion that the approach works "at times" and "well enough."

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- The article did not make explicit, dated predictions about future events. Its closing line—"Long may it continue to!"—expressed a hopeful continuation of reductionist drug discovery as a viable enterprise. This largely came true in the sense that reductionism remained central to drug R&D through the late 2010s and early 2020s, supported continued employment in the industry, and delivered new drugs (in oncology, immunology, and rare diseases). However, industry-wide R&D productivity remained constrained, and approved therapies often targeted well-understood pathways rather than breaking entirely new mechanistic ground.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 6/9**
This essay lucidly links first-principles sensory biology to drug-discovery practice using a clear, personal frame ("pays my mortgage"), and its examples (TRP channels, mechanical sensation) align with subsequent Nobel recognition and continued industrial focus. It avoided hype and focused on mechanism, which aged well relative to many contemporaneous commentaries.
