# The Palbociclib Saga: Or Why We Need a Lot of Drug Companies (August 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses palbociclib (PD-0332991), a selective CDK4/6 inhibitor developed by Parke-Davis (later Pfizer). The compound shows how promising drugs can get delayed by corporate mergers and reorganizations.

The story traces palbociclib from its synthesis in 2001, through years of neglect after Pfizer's mergers with Warner-Lambert and Pharmacia, to its eventual revival when academic researchers demonstrated its efficacy in breast cancer. The article highlights that the compound was nearly abandoned despite being "one of the most novel compounds ever produced" in its class. It emphasizes that such delays are common in drug development, where mergers and reorganizations can bury promising projects. The author argues this demonstrates why having multiple drug companies is valuable - when one company drops a project, others may pick it up.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the article's publication, palbociclib's development trajectory proved the compound's significance:

**Regulatory Approvals:** Palbociclib (Ibrance) received FDA accelerated approval in February 2015 for ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer in combination with letrozole, based on impressive Phase II data showing dramatically improved progression-free survival. This was just months after the article was published.

**Clinical Impact:** The drug demonstrated substantial clinical benefit, with the PALOMA-1 trial showing progression-free survival of 20.2 months versus 10.2 months for letrozole alone. Subsequent trials confirmed efficacy, leading to full approval and expanded indications.

**Market Adoption:** Ibrance became a blockbuster drug, generating billions in annual revenue and establishing CDK4/6 inhibition as a standard of care for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.

**Industry Landscape:** Other CDK4/6 inhibitors succeeded as predicted. Novartis's ribociclib (Kisqali) and Eli Lilly's abemaciclib (Verzenio) both received FDA approval, creating a competitive market. The "me-too" concern mentioned in the article proved unfounded - multiple CDK4/6 inhibitors provided meaningful treatment options with different side effect profiles.

**Predictive Validation:** The article's concerns about delays were validated - palbociclib could have reached patients years earlier. However, the industry's multi-company structure worked as intended, with multiple companies successfully developing CDK4/6 inhibitors.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction: Palbociclib would reach market success**
  - **Outcome: Correct.** Ibrance received FDA approval in 2015 and became a blockbuster, with 2023 sales exceeding $5 billion annually.

• **Prediction: Other companies (Novartis, Lilly) would succeed with their own CDK4/6 inhibitors**
  - **Outcome: Correct.** Both ribociclib (2017) and abemaciclib (2017) received FDA approval and became commercially successful, exactly as the author anticipated.

• **Prediction: "Fast-follower me-too" criticism would emerge**
  - **Outcome: Partially correct.** Some criticism existed, but the clinical value of having multiple CDK4/6 inhibitors with different side effect profiles generally justified the parallel development.

• **Prediction: Multiple drug companies prevent good science from being lost**
  - **Outcome: Validated.** The article's thesis was proven correct - when Pfizer initially neglected palbociclib, academic researchers and eventually other companies ensured CDK4/6 inhibition reached patients.

• **Implicit prediction: CDK4/6 inhibition would become an important therapeutic approach**
  - **Outcome: Correct.** CDK4/6 inhibitors became standard first-line therapy for hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer, representing one of the most significant advances in breast cancer treatment in decades.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrates excellent foresight about drug development challenges and successfully predicted the emergence of an important therapeutic class while highlighting systemic issues in pharmaceutical R&D that remain relevant today.
