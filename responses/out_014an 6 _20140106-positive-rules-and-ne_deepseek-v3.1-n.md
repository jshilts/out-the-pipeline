# Retrospective Analysis: "Positive Rules and Negative Ones" (Science, 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 article discusses the practical realities of medicinal chemistry decision-making, distinguishing between two types of empirical rules: negative rules (what to avoid, which are "moderately reliable" at predicting failure) and positive rules (what to try in specific situations, which have "very very low" predictive power). The author acknowledges that even negative rules have notable exceptions, citing unconventional but effective drugs like fosfomycin, nitroglycerine, and suramin. 

The article argues that medicinal chemistry remains an imprecise science where rules serve mainly to narrow options "from an impossible number to a highly improbable number" rather than providing certainty. The inherent uncertainty creates room for professional disagreement, as any guideline can be countered by someone's contradictory experience. The author suggests that until predictive capabilities improve significantly, medicinal chemistry will remain heavily dependent on empirical testing despite its apparent inefficiency.

## 2. HISTORY

The decade following this article's publication saw several developments relevant to its themes:

**Computational Advances**: AI and machine learning began addressing the article's core challenge. Deep learning models like AlphaFold (2020) revolutionized protein structure prediction, while AI platforms from companies like Atomwise, Exscientia, and BenevolentAI started demonstrating the ability to design drug candidates with higher success rates than traditional methods. By 2024, several AI-designed drugs had entered clinical trials.

**Continued Rule Refinement**: Lipinski's Rule of Five, mentioned in the article, evolved. Researchers developed more sophisticated models incorporating factors like intrinsic solubility, permeability, and metabolic stability. However, exceptions remained common - for instance, the successful development of PROTACs (proteolysis targeting chimeras) and molecular glues that routinely violate traditional drug-likeness rules.

**Structural Complexity Increases**: The trend toward more complex molecules accelerated. Between 2015-2020, FDA approvals increasingly included molecules with higher molecular weights, more hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and greater complexity than Rule-of-Five guidelines would suggest.

**Empirical Testing Remains Central**: Despite computational advances, clinical trial success rates remained relatively unchanged through 2024, hovering around 10-15% for new molecular entities. The fundamental uncertainty the article described persisted as a defining feature of drug discovery.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Accurate Predictions:**
- The article correctly anticipated that simple rules would remain insufficient for medicinal chemistry decision-making
- It accurately predicted that empirical testing would remain central to drug discovery processes
- The expectation that professional disagreements would continue proved correct - debates over drug design strategies intensified as computational tools multiplied

**Partially Accurate:**
- The prediction that "medicinal chemistry will change a great deal" when better predictive capabilities emerged was partially right. AI did revolutionize aspects of drug discovery, but the fundamental uncertainty and need for empirical validation remained

**Incorrect or Overstated:**
- The article may have underestimated the speed of computational progress. Within a decade, AI began providing meaningful improvements to success rates
- The implicit suggestion that medicinal chemistry approaches would remain relatively static proved too conservative - the field evolved significantly through integration of new technologies

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/9**

This article ranks in the 70th-79th percentile for interest and importance. While it addresses a specialized topic within drug discovery, it captures fundamental truths about the nature of scientific rules and empirical knowledge that extend far beyond medicinal chemistry. The piece demonstrates prescient understanding of how scientific fields actually function - balancing rules, exceptions, and evolving knowledge.

The article's central insight about the difference between negative (avoidance) and positive (prescriptive) rules has proven broadly applicable across many scientific and technical domains. Its realistic assessment of uncertainty management in complex systems remains relevant as AI and machine learning increasingly influence scientific decision-making.

However, the article falls short of the highest interest tier (8-9) because it focuses primarily on established challenges rather than proposing transformative solutions, and its scope remains largely confined to medicinal chemistry practices rather than broader scientific or societal implications.
