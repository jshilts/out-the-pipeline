# Cutting (And Re-Cutting) the Research Pie (May 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article provides an insider perspective on how biopharma research organizations allocate limited resources across competing drug discovery projects. The author describes how medicinal chemists are particularly prized resources, with project leaders often guarding their headcount jealously or constantly claiming they are resource-starved. The piece explains that resource needs vary throughout a project lifecycle—early-stage projects compete for high-throughput screening slots, protein purification, and assay development support, while later-stage projects fight over scale-up chemistry, toxicology slots, and formulation expertise. The author concludes that no organization ever feels these resources are truly abundant, and successful allocation depends heavily on interpersonal trust and working relationships rather than formal systems.

## 2. HISTORY
Since 2017, several significant trends have reshaped resource allocation in biopharmaceutical R&D. Small and medium biotechs have proliferated, collectively spending substantial capital—US biotechs raised approximately $120 billion in 2020-2021 across venture capital and IPOs, with R&D expenditures growing from around $20 billion in 2017 to over $28 billion by 2023. Computational approaches have increasingly guided target selection and candidate prioritization, potentially improving resource allocation efficiency through better upfront validation.

Therapeutic modalities have shifted, with notable growth in antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), bispecific antibodies, and especially oligonucleotide therapeutics—more than twenty antisense or siRNA drugs now have regulatory approval, with annual sales of key products reaching several billion dollars. These modalities present different resource allocation patterns than traditional small molecules, often requiring more specialized expertise in bioengineering, manufacturing, and delivery technologies rather than large medicinal chemistry teams.

Many biopharmas have refined portfolio management using AI-driven platforms for target identification, though the impact on internal resource allocation debates remains mixed. Clinical success rates have remained challenging, with recent analyses showing overall Phase 2 success rates of roughly 30-35% (varies by therapeutic area and modality), keeping pressure on resource allocation decisions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article makes no explicit predictions about future developments, instead focusing on enduring structural aspects of R&D organizations. It identifies persistent challenges rather than forecasting specific outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **2/10**
This article describes commonplace internal organizational dynamics in pharmaceutical R&D that were well-known long before 2017 and remain essentially unchanged today. While accurate, it does not provide novel insight, analytical depth, or forward-looking perspective that would make it stand out.
