# A Phase III Failure at Eli Lilly. Yes, Again. (September 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses Eli Lilly's latest Phase III clinical trial failure for ramucirumab in breast cancer treatment—one in a series of expensive late-stage setbacks as the company faced patent expirations on existing drugs. The author raises a broader question about risk management and portfolio strategy in pharmaceutical R&D: Should Eli Lilly be criticized for pursuing high-risk, high-reward targets (particularly Alzheimer's disease with its historically near-100% failure rate), or is this approach actually commendable for tackling "really big challenges" with unmet medical needs?

The central tension explored is whether Lilly's poor track record represents (1) a deliberately risky portfolio strategy aimed at breakthrough innovations, or (2) poor execution on a reasonably balanced portfolio. The piece also serves as a defense of the pharmaceutical industry against critics who accuse drug companies of avoiding difficult diseases in favor of "easy wins," arguing that even supposedly straightforward drug development carries terrifying failure rates.

## 2. HISTORY

**Ramucirumab's trajectory after 2013:**
- Despite the breast cancer failure highlighted in the article, ramucirumab went on to receive FDA approval in April 2014 for advanced gastric cancer
- Subsequently approved for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (December 2014) and metastatic colorectal cancer (April 2015)
- While it found clinical utility, ramucirumab did not become the blockbuster drug that Lilly had hoped would offset patent cliff losses

**Lilly's broader R&D outcomes:**
- The company experienced continued struggles in Alzheimer's drug development throughout the 2010s
- Solanezumab, Lilly's much-anticipated Alzheimer's antibody, failed multiple Phase III trials (2016-2017), resulting in billions in losses and validating the article's concerns about high-risk Alzheimer's investments
- However, Lilly eventually achieved major successes:
  - In diabetes, Trulicity (dulaglutide) gained approval in 2014 and became a multi-billion dollar GLP-1 agonist
  - Taltz (ixekizumab) for psoriasis/arthritis approved in 2016
  - Emgality (galcanezumab) for migraine prevention approved in 2018
  - Jardiance (empagliflozin) for diabetes and heart failure became a major revenue source

**The Alzheimer's landscape since 2013:**
- The field continued to see catastrophic failure rates as the article anticipated
- Biogen's aducanumab failed initial trials (2019), creating massive controversy
- Only one truly new Alzheimer's mechanism received approval (Biogen's Aduhelm in 2021), and it faced limited clinical uptake due to questionable efficacy and safety concerns
- Lilly's donanemab showed promise in Phase II (2021) but demonstrates that Alzheimer's remains extraordinarily challenging

**Business performance:**
- Lilly's stock recovered and substantially outperformed the market from 2020 onward
- The company successfully navigated the patent cliff period through diversification and strategic M&A
- By the early 2020s, Lilly became an innovator in diabetes, immunology, and oncology

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions and observations about pharmaceutical R&D and Lilly's strategy:

• **Prediction: Alzheimer's will continue to have exceptionally high failure rates**  
**Outcome:** ✓ **ACCURATE** - The subsequent decade proved this correct with multiple catastrophic Phase III failures across the industry, including Lilly's own solanezumab, reinforcing that Alzheimer's remained what the author called a "tent peg" for drug companies

• **Prediction: There are "no lay-ups" in drug development**  
**Outcome:** ✓ **ACCURATE** - Even seemingly straightforward drug development continued to show unexpectedly high failure rates, validating the author's defense of industry risk-taking

• **Prediction: Pursuing high-risk targets like Alzheimer's could "drive companies into the ground"**  
**Outcome:** ~ **PARTIALLY ACCURATE** - Lilly did suffer billions in Alzheimer's-related losses and multiple Phase III failures, but ultimately diversified successfully and recovered stronger than expected, suggesting the "tent peg" analogy was somewhat overstated

• **Prediction: Ramucirumab was positioned as crucial for Lilly's patent cliff strategy**  
**Outcome:** ✗ **INACCURATE** - While approved for some indications, ramucirumab did not become the major blockbuster Lilly needed; instead, unexpected successes in diabetes (Trulicity) and immunology (Taltz) filled this role

• **Implicit question: Should industry pursue high-risk, high-unmet-need diseases or play it safe?**  
**Outcome:** The subsequent decade showed that companies successfully pursuing breakthrough innovations (like Lilly with diabetes drugs, CAR-T companies in oncology, gene therapy firms) ultimately created more shareholder value than those playing defense, though with higher volatility

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

The article deserves credit for correctly anticipating continued Alzheimer's drug development failures and providing a nuanced defense of high-risk R&D strategy. However, it underestimated Lilly's ability to pivot and succeed through diversification, making its broader predictions about business outcomes less insightful. The piece captures an important truth about pharmaceutical risk management that remains relevant for understanding industry dynamics.
