# Selective Scaffolds (December 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article critiques a Journal of Medicinal Chemistry paper that investigated whether "privileged substructures" exist—molecular scaffolds with inherent selectivity for specific target classes. The Bonn research group analyzed ~6,000 compounds across 259 targets from the BindingDB database, finding about 18,000 compound-target interactions. Their analysis did identify some community-selective scaffolds (groupings like kinases, serine proteases, etc.), and within these sets, certain scaffolds showed selectivity against individual family members.

However, the article's author raises significant concerns. The most impressive selectivity numbers appear concentrated in just a few target families—serine proteases, kinases, adenosine receptors, and DPP inhibitors. Remove these, and the evidence for broadly privileged scaffolds weakens considerably. Additionally, many of the identified scaffolds appear too large (molecular weight >400) for practical drug development, falling into the "drug-like" rather than "lead-like" category that medicinal chemists actually need for optimization. The author suggests this reflects bias in the underlying database, which contains compounds skewed toward higher molecular weights.

## 2. HISTORY
After this 2009 critique, scaffold-based drug discovery continued evolving with more sophisticated computational approaches. Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) gained significant traction, particularly using smaller, "lead-like" fragments rather than large drug-like molecules. FBDD success stories emerged, including FDA approvals like vemurafenib (2011) and venetoclax (2016), which were developed from fragment screens against specific targets.

The concept of privileged scaffolds became more nuanced—rather than universal privileged structures, researchers focused on target-class-specific scaffold preferences. The kinase field particularly validated this approach, where certain hinge-binding motifs (e.g., aminopyrimidines, indazoles) became established as "kinase-privileged" due to their ability to access the ATP-binding site. Several kinase inhibitors leveraging these scaffolds reached FDA approval, including ibrutinib (2013) and palbociclib (2015).

However, concerns about database bias and the "success-breeds-success" phenomenon persisted. Subsequent research confirmed that the structural diversity gap remained a significant challenge, with calls for more systematic exploration of underrepresented chemical space. The BindingDB database itself continued expanding, reaching over 1 million binding measurements by the mid-2010s, though structural bias remained an ongoing concern.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Scaffold selectivity concentration**: The article suggested that apparent privileged scaffolds might be concentrated in just a few target families (kinases, serine proteases, adenosine receptors, DPP inhibitors). This proved largely accurate—kinase inhibitors particularly became one of the most successful drug classes exploiting scaffold-target relationships, while serine protease inhibitors saw more limited clinical success.

• **Size and drug-likeness concerns**: The concern that many identified scaffolds were too large (molecular weight >400) for practical development reflected real limitations. The field increasingly emphasized smaller, "lead-like" starting points, validated by the success of fragment-based approaches that explicitly used smaller fragments (~150-250 Da) as starting points.

• **Database bias perpetuation**: The implicit concern about "success-breeds-success" patterns proved prescient—subsequent analyses confirmed that chemical structure novelty declined in some databases, with known privileged scaffolds being further elaborated rather than new ones discovered.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**
This article provided a thoughtful critique of methodology and highlighted practical concerns about scaffold size and database bias that remained relevant. However, it focused on a fairly niche methodological debate without broader implications for patient outcomes or major technological shifts.
