# Fragonomics, Eh? (August 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a piece by Edward "Teddy Z" Zartler on fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD), which Zartler terms "fragonomics." Zartler's core argument is that FBDD's strength lies not simply in using smaller molecules, but in leveraging molecules that make only favorable interactions with the target. Larger molecules often contain both strong binding elements and portions that actually weaken binding. Starting small allows investigators to build out systematically, avoiding "landmines" and maintaining high "ligand efficiency"—a concept Zartler explains intuitively without equations. He also highlights how simpler fragments enable rapid structure-activity relationship (SAR) exploration through commercial sourcing or existing compound libraries, which defers medicinal chemists' involvement until later stages—an efficiency gain given their high demand.

Zartler's provocative conclusion declares that "Fragonomics has won the field" and proclaims "the age of the medchemist is over; now is the time of the biophysicist." The article's author expresses concern that such rhetoric risks alienating medicinal chemists, making them wary of FBDD approaches. The author also critiques the term "fragonomics" itself as an unnecessary neologism, feeling the omnipresent "-omics" suffix might trigger dismissal by those fatigued with trendy terminology.

## 2. HISTORY

Since 2014, fragment-based drug discovery has become thoroughly established and integrated into pharmaceutical research, though perhaps not with the revolutionary displacement Zartler suggested.

FBDD has delivered multiple FDA-approved drugs, demonstrating real-world clinical impact. The most prominent example is **venurafenib (Zelboraf)**, approved in 2011 for BRAF V600E mutation-positive melanoma, which originated from fragment screening. Other successes include **venetoclax (Venclexta)**, a BCL-2 inhibitor approved in 2016 for certain leukemias, and **erdafitinib (Balversa)**, a pan-FGFR inhibitor approved in 2019 for bladder cancer. These approvals validated FBDD's ability to generate clinically effective medicines.

However, the field evolved more as a complementary tool rather than a complete replacement for medicinal chemistry. Major pharmaceutical companies (Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Novartis) and specialized biotechs (such as Astex Pharmaceuticals, which has long championed FBDD) incorporated fragment approaches into their discovery pipelines. Fragment screening became particularly valuable for tackling difficult targets (protein-protein interactions, allosteric sites) where traditional high-throughput screening struggled.

The predicted dominance of biophysicists over medicinal chemists did not materialize. Instead, successful drug discovery required close collaboration between biophysicists (providing structural data, biophysical binding assays) and medicinal chemists (optimizing fragments into drug-like molecules). The term "fragonomics" largely failed to catch on; the field continues to be called fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) or fragment-based lead discovery (FBLD).

Technological advancement occurred in fragment screening methodologies (surface plasmon resonance, NMR, X-ray crystallography, thermal shift assays) and computational approaches. However, the fundamental challenge of fragment-to-lead optimization remained substantial—fragments often required extensive chemical modification to achieve potency, selectivity, and acceptable drug properties.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Fragonomics has won the field"**: This prediction proved partially correct. FBDD became a mainstream, widely adopted approach in drug discovery, with numerous pharmaceutical companies establishing fragment screening capabilities. However, it did not "win" in the sense of displacing other discovery methods. FBDD became one important tool among many (including high-throughput screening, DNA-encoded libraries, structure-based design), not the exclusive paradigm.

• **"The age of the medchemist is over; now is the time of the biophysicist"**: This prediction was incorrect. Medicinal chemists remained absolutely essential for converting fragment hits into optimized drug candidates. The most successful implementations involved close biophysicist-chemist collaboration, not replacement of one discipline by another. Medicinal chemistry expertise was critical for addressing the complex challenges of potency optimization, ADME properties, and synthesizing elaborate analogs during fragment elaboration.

• **Implicit prediction about "ligand efficiency" concepts dominating drug design**: Ligand efficiency metrics (LE, LLE) became widely used in lead optimization across the industry, not limited to FBDD. These concepts helped guide optimization by assessing whether potency gains justified increased molecular size. However, they did not eliminate the need for empirical optimization or replace medicinal chemistry judgment.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article captures an interesting moment in FBDD's maturation, highlighting legitimate scientific principles while revealing the dangers of overstatement. The field succeeded more through integration than revolution, making this a useful case study in how scientific methodologies actually evolve in practice.
