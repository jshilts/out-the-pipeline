# Patent Trolling, Money and Fun (September 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post reacts to a **Nature News** story about *Classen Immunotherapies, Inc. v. Biogen IDEC et al.*.  Classen held patents that claimed the idea of “linking infant vaccination schedules with later immune‑disorder risk” – essentially a method of reading the scientific literature and arranging vaccines to minimise adverse immune outcomes.  

A district court had dismissed the patents as abstract ideas, but the Federal Circuit (CAFC) reversed after the Supreme Court’s 2010 *Bilski* decision, finding two of the three claims patent‑eligible under 35 U.S.C. §101.  The author uses the case to illustrate a broader concern: **patent‑trolling** in biotechnology.  He cites James Bessen’s work on “patent trolls,” mentions earlier biotech‑related trolling (e.g., Ariad’s NF‑κB patents), and points to Intellectual Ventures and its network of shell companies in Marshall, Texas, as evidence that non‑producing entities were beginning to target biotech firms with broad, often abstract patents.

## 2. HISTORY  
**What actually happened to the Classen patents?**  
- After the CAFC’s 2011 opinion, the case was sent back to the district court for further analysis under §§ 102, 103 and 112.  In 2013 the district court **invalidated the patents** on lack of written description and enablement, and the decision was upheld on appeal.  The patents never survived to issuance of a final, enforceable right, and no precedent was set that broadened biotech patent eligibility.  

**Supreme Court and legislative developments that reshaped the landscape**  
- **Mayo v. Prometheus (2012)** and **Myriad v. Association for Molecular Pathology (2013)** sharply limited patents on natural phenomena and isolated DNA, reinforcing the view that merely applying known correlations (as in Classen’s claims) is not patent‑eligible.  
- The **America Invents Act (2011)** introduced post‑grant review and covered business method review, giving defendants a faster route to challenge overly broad patents.  
- **Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank (2014)** extended the abstract‑idea doctrine to software‑related biotech claims (e.g., diagnostic algorithms), further discouraging “method‑of‑treatment” patents that do not claim a concrete composition of matter.  

**Patent‑trolling activity in biotech after 2011**  
- **Intellectual Ventures** continued to acquire biotech patents, but high‑profile lawsuits (e.g., against **Novartis** in 2014 over a cancer‑treatment method) were largely dismissed or settled for modest sums.  The firm’s aggressive posture attracted legislative scrutiny, and the **Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB)** began issuing more institution‑wide re‑examinations that often invalidated troll‑targeted claims.  
- **James Bessen’s** 2012 follow‑up study showed a modest decline in the number of biotech “troll” suits after 2011, correlating with the rise of PTAB reviews and the *Alice* decision.  
- The biotech industry’s own patent‑licensing strategies shifted toward **defensive patent pools** (e.g., the **Biotechnology Innovation Organization’s** “BIA” pool) and **open‑science collaborations**, reducing the pool of low‑quality patents that trolls could exploit.  

**Real‑world impact on companies mentioned**  
- **Biogen IDEC** (later **Biogen**) continued to develop its antibody portfolio (e.g., **Tysabri**, **Ocrevus**) without any material disruption from the Classen case.  
- **Classen Immunotherapies** never commercialised a product; the company dissolved after the patents were invalidated.  

Overall, the feared “wave of biotech patent trolls” did not materialise at the scale suggested in 2011.  Legal reforms and Supreme Court jurisprudence curtailed the enforceability of overly broad, abstract biotech patents, and the industry adapted by strengthening defensive IP strategies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2011 article | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Broad “vaccination‑schedule” patents could be enforced against major biotech firms.** | The Classen patents were ultimately invalidated; no major biotech company was forced to pay damages or alter vaccine programs. |
| **Patent trolls would increasingly target biotech, draining R&D resources.** | Troll activity rose briefly (2011‑2013) but declined after *Alice* and PTAB reforms; the sector’s litigation rate fell relative to other high‑tech fields. |
| **Intellectual Ventures’ biotech portfolio would become a major litigation engine.** | IV filed a few biotech suits, but most were dismissed or settled for negligible amounts; the firm’s focus shifted back to software and electronics patents. |
| **Biotech firms would have to spend more time defending against vague, abstract patents.** | Defensive patent pools and increased use of PTAB challenges reduced the time spent on such defenses; many firms report lower litigation overhead than in the early 2000s. |
| **The “natural‑phenomena” patent‑eligibility question would remain unsettled, encouraging more filings of similar patents.** | *Mayo* (2012) and *Myriad* (2013) clarified the law, making it riskier to file broad method‑of‑treatment claims; filing rates for such patents dropped sharply after 2013. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The piece captures a moment of tension between biotech innovation and patent‑trolling tactics, and it foreshadows legal shifts that later reshaped the field, making it a useful historical snapshot even though many of its alarmist predictions did not fully materialise.
