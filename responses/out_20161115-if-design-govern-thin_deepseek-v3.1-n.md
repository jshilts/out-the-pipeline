# If Design Govern in a Thing So Small (November 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article analyzes the immediate post-election surge in biopharma stocks following Trump's victory in November 2016. The author identifies two likely drivers that investors were betting on: (1) expected corporate tax reform that would make it easier for large pharmaceutical companies to repatriate offshore earnings, potentially fueling acquisition activity; and (2) expectations of a more industry-friendly, "tolerant FDA" under the new administration.

The author expresses skepticism about the second rationale, analyzing Trump's real estate background and zero-sum transactional worldview as ill-suited to understanding the scientific complexity of drug regulation. The article predicts that FDA policy would likely remain relatively stable, as the agency would be low on the new administration's priority list during the transition period. The piece includes an extended literary digression on Robert Frost's poem "Design" to explore themes of divine indifference versus active malevolence.

## 2. HISTORY

**FDA Policy and Leadership:** The author's prediction that FDA policy would see little immediate change proved largely accurate. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb was not confirmed until May 2017, nearly five months into the Trump administration, reflecting the lower prioritization the author anticipated. While Gottlieb proved more industry-friendly than expected (focusing on streamlining approvals and generic competition), the fundamental regulatory framework for drug approval remained intact without the radical deregulation some had feared.

**Biopharma Market Performance:** The anticipated biopharma boom tied to corporate tax reform materialized partially. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 did lower corporate rates and included repatriation provisions. However, much of the repatriated cash was used for stock buybacks rather than the R&D investment or acquisitions that investors had hoped would drive innovation. Biopharma stocks saw mixed performance in subsequent years, with sector dynamics depending more on drug pipelines, patent cliffs, and demographic trends than tax policy.

**Acquisition Activity:** Large pharmaceutical companies did continue acquiring smaller biotech firms, but this trend began well before 2016 and continued through various administrations. The pace of M&A activity showed no dramatic acceleration specifically attributable to Trump-era policies.

**Drug Approval Rates:** FDA approval rates for new drugs did increase under Gottlieb, reaching record numbers in 2018, but this reflected both administrative streamlining and strong pharmaceutical pipelines rather than any fundamental change to the scientific standards for safety and efficacy.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: FDA policy would see minimal immediate changes because the agency would be low on the new administration's priority list.

  **Reality**: **Mostly accurate**. Scott Gottlieb's confirmation was delayed until May 2017, and while he implemented efficiency improvements, no radical regulatory overhaul occurred. The FDA maintained its scientific standards for drug approval throughout the Trump administration.

• **Prediction**: The market's optimism about a "tolerant FDA" was premature and potentially misguided based on Trump's transactional worldview being ill-suited to scientific regulation.

  **Reality**: **Partially accurate**. Gottlieb did prove more industry-friendly than expected, and approval rates increased, but the fundamental scientific review process remained rigorous. The market's early enthusiasm was somewhat justified by faster approvals, though not by regulatory capture.

• **Prediction**: The repatriation cash rationale for biopharma stock increases might be more sound than the FDA deregulation thesis.

  **Reality**: **Mixed**. Tax reform did free up overseas cash, but companies largely used it for shareholder returns rather than transformative R&D investment, limiting the sector-wide impact the market had anticipated.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates thoughtful analysis that mostly holds up, offering insightful predictions about regulatory continuity and market psychology that proved reasonably accurate despite the post-election euphoria. The author's skepticism of radical FDA change proved prescient, and the extended literary analogy provides genuinely sophisticated cultural framing.
