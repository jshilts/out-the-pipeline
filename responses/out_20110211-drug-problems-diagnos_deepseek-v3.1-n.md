# Drug Problems: A Diagnosis (February 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article discusses a JPET paper by pharmacologist Michael Williams (Northwestern, formerly of Merck, Novartis, Abbott, and Cephalon) that critiques the pharmaceutical industry's trajectory in drug discovery. The central thesis is that "Drug discovery forgot pharmacology and lost its way," arguing that the genomics era and target-driven molecular biology approaches led the field astray.

Williams contended that the industry became overly seduced by technology, with tools like high-throughput screening (HTS) and combinatorial chemistry becoming ends in themselves rather than means to answer focused biological questions. The article highlights two major GPCR target families—opioid receptors and muscarinic receptors—as examples of potentially intractable targets. Despite 40 years of intensive research and promising preclinical data, selective agonists for opioid receptor subtypes (mu, delta, kappa) still hadn't delivered the hoped-for analgesics without respiratory depression, tolerance, constipation, and addiction side effects. Similarly, muscarinic ligands remained problematic despite extensive medicinal chemistry efforts. The critique concludes with practical recommendations, requested by a reviewer, emphasizing more rigorous data analysis, physiologically relevant models, and allowing time for unconventional approaches.

## 2. HISTORY

**Innovation Gap Persists**: The fundamental "pipeline problem" Williams identified in 2011 continued through the 2010s. Industry R&D productivity metrics showed little improvement, with estimated R&D costs per approved drug remaining persistently high (often cited at \$1-3+ billion) and approval rates stagnant despite massive investment in genomics and related technologies.

**Genomics Revolution's Mixed Results**: While genomic sequencing costs plummeted exponentially (human genome sequencing dropped from \$100M in 2001 to under \$1,000 by 2015), the promised flood of new druggable targets largely failed to materialize. The vast majority of genome-wide association study (GWAS)-identified disease variants proved to have small effect sizes or were in non-coding regions, making them poor drug targets. By the mid-2010s, many pharmaceutical companies scaled back investment in pure genomics-driven discovery.

**Opioid Crisis Worsens**: The "intractable" opioid target problem Williams described became tragically relevant. Rather than developing safer opioids, the 2010s witnessed North America's devastating opioid crisis, driven by overprescribing of existing opioids and the emergence of synthetic fentanyl. By 2017, the crisis was declared a public health emergency in the U.S., with over 70,000 overdose deaths annually. Pharmaceutical company Purdue Pharma faced massive litigation over OxyContin marketing, eventually filing bankruptcy in 2019. The search for non-addictive analgesics using the approaches Williams critiqued largely failed—no new mechanistic class of non-addictive opioid reached widespread clinical practice during this period. Instead, naloxone (an existing opioid antagonist) became widely deployed as an emergency rescue medication.

**Muscarinic Targets Remain Challenging**: Development of selective muscarinic ligands continued to struggle. While some compounds reached clinical trials, most failed due to side effects from lack of selectivity across the five muscarinic receptor subtypes, validating Williams' concerns about the complexity of these systems.

**Technological Evolution**: The HTS and combinatorial chemistry approaches Williams questioned evolved rather than disappeared. Fragment-based drug discovery gained prominence, showing modest success. High-resolution cryo-EM emerged, enabling better target structure determination. However, the fundamental challenge of translating molecular targeting into viable therapeutics remained.

**Business Consolidation**: The traditional large pharma model continued facing headwinds. Several companies announced major R&D site closures in the early-to-mid 2010s (Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Novartis). R&D became more externally focused, with increased reliance on acquisitions of biotech companies and academic partnerships.

**Regulatory Shifts**: The FDA's expedited pathways (Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review, Fast Track) expanded during the 2010s, leading to faster approvals, particularly in oncology and rare diseases. However, accelerated attrition of early-stage programs persisted, suggesting the bottleneck moved earlier in the pipeline rather than at regulatory review.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Williams' implicit prediction that the "safety-free" selective opioid would remain elusive**: **Accurate**. Despite enormous investment, no selective opioid receptor subtype agonist achieved broad clinical success as a non-addictive analgesic by the mid-2020s. The opposite occurred—the opioid crisis demonstrated the limitations of existing pharmacology.

• **Williams' concern that genomics would generate "a long list of orphan receptors and whatzitases" rather than tractable drug targets**: **Largely accurate**. While some successful targeted therapies emerged (particularly in oncology with drugs like imatinib), the genomics revolution produced more targets of uncertain druggability than immediate therapeutic breakthroughs. Systematic studies showed that the "druggable genome" remained much smaller than the full genome, with protein-protein interactions and transcription factors proving particularly challenging.

• **Williams' prediction that technology-driven approaches alone wouldn't solve fundamental biology challenges**: **Appears accurate**. While some technological advances (like CRISPR or cryo-EM) had impact, the core challenges of predictably translating molecular interventions into clinical benefits remained. Artificial intelligence/machine learning entered drug discovery in the late 2010s, but by the early 2020s had produced limited clinical success, suggesting technology augmentation rather than replacement of traditional pharmacology is ongoing.

• **Derek Lowe's implicit prediction that the industry knew these problems**: **Accurate**. R&D productivity remained a persistent concern throughout the 2010s, with numerous industry reports and analyses documenting continued challenges. The solutions proved consistently difficult to implement, confirming Lowe's observation that "there needs no ghost... come from the grave" to explain these issues.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **9/10**

This article's critique proved prescient about the biopharmaceutical industry's persistent challenges, particularly around genomics translation, opioid research failures, and fundamental pharmacology's importance. It connects directly to consequential outcomes—the opioid crisis, continued R&D productivity problems, and the gap between molecular biology advances and therapeutic impact. An exceptionally insightful analysis that diagnosed structural problems that would manifest for a decade.
