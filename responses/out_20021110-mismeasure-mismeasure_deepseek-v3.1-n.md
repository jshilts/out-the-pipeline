# Mismeasure for Mismeasure (November 2002)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article challenges the widespread corporate practice of using normal distribution (bell curve) assumptions in employee performance evaluations. The author argues that technical organizations, particularly in research fields, do not and should not exhibit normal performance distributions because hiring processes already filter out incompetent candidates through educational and professional barriers. Instead, the author contends that realistic performance rankings should show a majority at "Meets Expectations" with a remainder stretching toward higher performance levels, and very few people genuinely below expectations (who should either improve or be dismissed).

The article specifically criticizes Jack Welch's "rank and yank" approach—the practice of identifying and firing the bottom 10% of performers—arguing this creates arbitrary distinctions among fundamentally competent employees and sows organizational discord. The author advocates for managers to identify and remove genuinely poor performers based on merit rather than enforcing artificial distribution quotas.

## 2. HISTORY

The debate over forced ranking systems continued intensively in the decades following this article. Many major companies that adopted Welch-style forced ranking eventually abandoned or significantly modified these practices:

**Microsoft's pivot (2013)**: One of the most notable reversals occurred when Microsoft eliminated its "stack ranking" system after years of internal criticism that it fostered unhealthy competition, discouraged collaboration, and forced managers to assign artificial low ratings to competent employees. This change reflected growing recognition that the system was damaging innovation and employee morale.

**General Electric's evolution**: Even GE, where Welch pioneered the approach, moved away from strict forced ranking in later years under different leadership, adopting more nuanced performance management approaches.

**Corporate trend away from forced ranking**: Throughout the 2010s, numerous Fortune 500 companies (including Adobe, Gap, and others) eliminated forced ranking systems, often replacing them with more frequent, developmental feedback approaches. However, some companies maintained variations of the system, particularly in high-performance sales cultures.

**HR research developments**: Academic and industry research increasingly supported the article's core arguments, showing that forced ranking can reduce collaboration, increase political behavior, and may not actually improve overall organizational performance. The growth of agile methodologies and collaborative work environments made rigid individual ranking systems increasingly incompatible with modern workplace practices.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions:

• **Forced ranking would prove counterproductive**: ✓ **Largely validated** - Many major adopters (Microsoft, Adobe, etc.) eventually abandoned these systems citing the exact problems the author described: artificial distinctions, reduced collaboration, and negative cultural impact.

• **The approach would sow "fear and discord"**: ✓ **Validated** - Subsequent corporate disclosures and employee testimonials (particularly from Microsoft during its stack ranking era) confirmed this prediction, with widespread reports of toxic competition and gaming of the system.

• **Good managers can identify poor performers without forced systems**: ✓ **Validated** - The shift toward more nuanced performance management and continuous feedback demonstrated that organizations could effectively manage performance without artificial distribution requirements.

• **Normal distribution assumptions are inappropriate for professional organizations**: ✓ **Validated** - Research and practical experience confirmed that professional hiring processes create naturally skewed distributions, making forced normal distributions mathematically and practically inappropriate.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates remarkable prescience about organizational dynamics and performance management, correctly predicting the eventual backlash against forced ranking systems. The core insight—that intelligent hiring naturally skews performance distributions—has proven broadly applicable beyond the specific time and industry context.
