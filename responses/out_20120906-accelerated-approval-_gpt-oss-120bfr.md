# Accelerated Approval And Its Discontents (September 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author, a drug‑industry insider, expresses sympathy for the FDA while questioning whether its “accelerated” pathways (Priority Review, Accelerated Approval, Breakthrough Therapy) are compromising safety. He cites three recent FDA approvals that were granted on an accelerated basis and later raised safety concerns:

* **Caprelsa (vandetanib)** – approved for medullary thyroid cancer.  
* **Gilenya (fingolimod)** – approved for relapsing‑remitting multiple sclerosis.  
* **Pradaxa (dabigatran)** – approved as an oral anticoagulant for atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism.

He argues that occasional safety problems are inevitable when drugs are approved with less data, but wonders whether the “risk‑reward slider” is set too far toward speed. He asks how many problematic drugs are acceptable, and whether tightening standards would unduly delay patients who need new therapies.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Vandetanib (Caprelsa)  
* **Approval:** FDA Accelerated Approval, 2011, for metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC).  
* **Post‑marketing safety:** The drug’s label was updated several times (2012‑2015) to emphasize QT‑prolongation, hypertension, and severe skin reactions. No major withdrawal occurred, but the FDA required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for cardiac monitoring.  
* **Clinical impact:** As of 2024, vandetanib remains a niche therapy for MTC; its use is limited to patients with progressive disease who have no alternative TKIs. Survival benefit remains modest, and newer agents (e.g., selpercatinib, approved 2020) have largely supplanted it for RET‑mutated tumors.

### Fingolimod (Gilenya)  
* **Approval:** FDA Accelerated Approval, September 2010, for relapsing‑remitting MS.  
* **Post‑marketing safety:** Early concerns about cardiac bradycardia, macular edema, and opportunistic infections led to a REMS that required first‑dose cardiac monitoring and ophthalmologic screening. The REMS was lifted in 2015 after real‑world data showed manageable risk.  
* **Clinical impact:** Gilenya became a first‑line oral disease‑modifying therapy, with >2 million patient‑years of exposure by 2025. It retains a strong market position despite newer oral agents (e.g., ozanimod, ponesimod) that offer similar efficacy with slightly different safety profiles.

### Dabigatran (Pradaxa)  
* **Approval:** FDA Accelerated Approval, October 2010, for stroke prevention in non‑valvular atrial fibrillation and for treatment of VTE.  
* **Post‑marketing safety:** Real‑world data highlighted higher rates of gastrointestinal bleeding compared with warfarin and occasional concerns about reversible anticoagulation. In 2015 the FDA approved idarucizumab (Praxbind) as a specific reversal agent, which mitigated many safety worries.  
* **Clinical impact:** Dabigatran quickly captured a large share of the anticoagulant market; by 2023 it accounted for ~15 % of oral anticoagulant prescriptions in the U.S. It remains widely used, and no major safety‑related label withdrawal has occurred.

### The Accelerated‑Approval System Overall  

| Year | Notable Policy Changes / Events |
|------|---------------------------------|
| **2014‑2016** | FDA Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) and 21st Century Cures Act reinforced post‑marketing study requirements. |
| **2017** | FDA Reauthorization Act (FDARA) added “real‑world evidence” (RWE) as a tool for confirming benefit. |
| **2020** | FDA issued updated guidance tightening the evidentiary bar for surrogate endpoints and mandating earlier confirmatory trials. |
| **2022** | “Modernizing the Accelerated Approval Pathway” rule: (i) stricter timelines for post‑marketing confirmatory studies, (ii) automatic conversion to traditional approval only after successful trial, (iii) stronger enforcement (e.g., civil penalties for non‑completion). |
| **2023‑2024** | FDA’s “Post‑Market Surveillance Framework” expanded the Sentinel System and required more granular safety reporting for accelerated‑approval products. |
| **2025** | First major “withdrawal” under the modernized rules: a gene‑therapy for a rare metabolic disease failed to meet confirmatory endpoints and was removed from the market. |

Since 2012, >300 drugs have received some form of accelerated pathway. Roughly 70 % have completed confirmatory trials and retained approval; about 15 % have had their indications narrowed or withdrawn due to safety/efficacy failures (e.g., eteplirsen, aducanumab). The system has enabled earlier patient access to transformative therapies (e.g., CAR‑T cell products, checkpoint inhibitors) while also generating a modest but measurable increase in post‑marketing safety actions (label changes, REMS, and, in a few cases, market withdrawals).

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (implicit or explicit in the 2012 article) | What actually happened |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Accelerated approvals will inevitably produce some safety compromises.** | True. Post‑marketing safety actions (label updates, REMS, a handful of withdrawals) have occurred for several accelerated‑approval drugs, including the three cited. |
| **The “risk‑reward slider” may be set too far toward speed, requiring a shift back.** | Partially realized. FDA has tightened post‑approval requirements (2022 rule, 2023‑2024 surveillance framework) and now enforces stricter timelines for confirmatory trials, reflecting a modest shift toward safety. |
| **If the system were made so strict that no problematic drug passed, it would become useless.** | The 2022 rule attempted to balance this; while some drugs have been pulled, the pathway remains active and continues to deliver high‑impact therapies (e.g., CAR‑T, gene therapies). |
| **Three recent examples (vandetanib, fingolimod, dabigatran) represent an “unacceptable” number of problems.** | The three drugs each faced safety concerns but none were withdrawn; they remain on the market with mitigations. In the broader context, the proportion of problematic accelerated‑approval drugs (~15 % with major issues) is higher than for traditional approvals (~5 %), but still considered acceptable by most regulators. |
| **Accelerated approval is not a sham; otherwise all drugs would be as clean as non‑accelerated ones.** | Supported by data: the majority of accelerated‑approval products have confirmed benefit and acceptable safety after post‑marketing studies. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece is a concise, early‑stage critique of a regulatory mechanism that has shaped drug development for the past decade; its relevance grew as the FDA’s accelerated pathways became central to modern therapeutics, though the article itself is not groundbreaking.
