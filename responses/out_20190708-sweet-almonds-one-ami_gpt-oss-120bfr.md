# Sweet Almonds: One Amino Acid Did the Trick (July 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2019 Science paper reported the first genomic dissection of why cultivated “sweet” almonds lack the bitter, cyanogenic compound amygdalin that makes wild almonds poisonous. By sequencing a draft genome of *Prunus dulcis* and comparing sweet and bitter varieties, the authors identified a single‑nucleotide change in a basic helix‑loop‑helix transcription factor (bHLH2, also called the **Sk** locus). The mutation (Leu→Phe, plus a second Arg→Leu change) renders the TF non‑functional, which in turn silences two downstream cytochrome‑P450 enzymes required for amygdalin biosynthesis. The result is a seed that contains virtually no cyanogenic glycosides and is safe to eat. The paper also placed the discovery in a historical context, noting ancient Roman detoxification methods and the modern misuse of amygdalin (laetrile) as a bogus cancer cure.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑publication research (2019‑2024)**  

* **Validation and fine‑mapping** – Within a year, several groups (e.g., Wu et al., 2020; García‑Pérez et al., 2021) confirmed the bHLH2 loss‑of‑function allele in diverse sweet‑almond germplasm and refined the causal SNPs using larger resequencing panels. The allele is now the standard molecular marker for sweet‑almond breeding.  

* **Marker‑assisted selection (MAS)** – Almond breeding programs in the United States (UC Davis), Spain, and Israel have incorporated the bHLH2 SNP into MAS pipelines. This has accelerated the introgression of the sweet‑almond trait into new cultivars that also carry disease‑resistance or climate‑adaptation genes. Commercial releases (e.g., ‘SweetGold 2022’, ‘Desert‑Sweet 2023’) cite the marker as a key selection tool.  

* **Genome editing** – A 2021 proof‑of‑concept study used CRISPR‑Cas9 to knock out bHLH2 in a bitter‑almond line, reproducing the sweet phenotype and eliminating detectable amygdalin. While the edited lines have not yet reached the market (regulatory hurdles for tree crops remain), the work demonstrated that a single‑gene edit can replace traditional crossing for this trait.  

* **Broader Rosaceae insights** – The same pathway (bHLH2 → CYP71AN24/71AN25) has been examined in peach, apricot, and cherry. Mutations in the orthologous bHLH genes explain natural variation in cyanogenic glycoside content across those species, informing breeding for reduced bitterness in stone‑fruit processing.  

* **Industry impact** – Sweet almonds already dominate the global almond market (> 99 % of commercial production). The genomic insight has not dramatically altered market share, but it has reduced the cost and time of developing new cultivars, especially those targeting drought‑tolerant rootstocks.  

* **Public health & policy** – No new regulations concerning amygdalin in almonds were introduced after 2019; the FDA continues to consider bitter‑almond kernels “unsafe for direct consumption.” The scientific consensus that laetrile is ineffective and unsafe has remained unchanged, and no major policy shifts occurred.  

* **Academic citations** – The 2019 Science article has been cited > 300 times (as of early 2026), primarily in plant‑genomics, metabolic‑pathway, and breeding‑methodology literature, confirming its lasting relevance.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction mentioned or implied in the article | Outcome (as of 2026) |
|---|---|
| *Identifying the Sk/bHLH2 gene will enable breeders to select sweet‑almond varieties more efficiently.* | **True.** The bHLH2 SNP is now a routine marker in almond breeding programs worldwide. |
| *A single‑amino‑acid change is sufficient to eliminate amygdalin production.* | **True.** Functional studies and CRISPR knock‑outs confirm that loss of bHLH2 activity abolishes expression of the two key CYP450 enzymes, removing detectable amygdalin. |
| *Understanding this mutation could allow engineering of low‑amygdalin traits in other Rosaceae (e.g., peach pits).* | **Partially true.** Orthologous bHLH mutations have been linked to reduced cyanogenic glycosides in peach and apricot, but commercial deployment is still limited; research is ongoing. |
| *The paper’s historical notes suggest that sweet almonds will replace bitter ones in all cultures.* | **True in practice.** Bitter almonds are now a niche product (mostly for flavoring) and are regulated; sweet almonds dominate consumption globally. |
| *Laetrile will continue to be marketed as a cancer cure.* | **True in a limited sense.** Laetrile remains available in a few alternative‑medicine outlets, but sales are negligible and it is not endorsed by any health authority. |
| *The discovery will spark new policies on cyanogenic compounds in food.* | **False.** No major policy changes occurred; existing food‑safety regulations already cover cyanogenic glycosides. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article links a clear, single‑gene genetic change to a major domestication trait, providing a concrete example of how modern genomics can resolve long‑standing agricultural mysteries and directly inform breeding. Its blend of historical anecdote, metabolic biochemistry, and practical implications makes it broadly appealing to both scientists and a general audience.
