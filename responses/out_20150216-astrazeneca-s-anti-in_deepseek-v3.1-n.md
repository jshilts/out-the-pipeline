# AstraZeneca's Anti-Infective Woes (February 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes AstraZeneca's difficulties in spinning out its anti-infectives division as a complete package. According to industry sources cited in the piece, the company was trying to sell off the entire division—including the full pipeline of assets and a 20-person team—in a single transaction to venture groups that had been active in anti-infectives investing.

The core problem was a mismatch in valuation expectations: potential buyers found that the assets had "little (if any) differentiation" and were "late to the market," making the economics unworkable. Buyers were interested in only a "couple of interesting assets" but balked at paying for the entire portfolio that included many uninteresting assets. The article notes that the process had dragged on longer than AstraZeneca had intended, raising questions about team retention among the 20-person group during the extended divestiture attempt.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2015 attempt to spin out its anti-infectives division, AstraZeneca ultimately succeeded in divesting these assets through a different structure. In **November 2015**, AstraZeneca announced it would sell its small molecule anti-infectives business to **Pfizer** for up to $1.575 billion. The deal included the marketed antibiotic Merrem/Meronem (meropenem) and two pipeline assets: the approved antibiotic Zavicefta (ceftazidime-avibactam) and the late-stage candidate aztreonam-avibactam.

The economics of this transaction were notably different from what the 2015 article suggested venture groups were willing to pay. Pfizer paid $550 million upfront plus potential milestone payments, acquiring global commercial rights (excluding North America and certain other markets for Merrem). This represented a strategic acquisition for Pfizer, which was rebuilding its anti-infectives portfolio after having divested its own established products business in 2014.

The antibiotics market faced continued challenges after 2015. While Zavicefta received regulatory approvals (EMA in 2016, FDA in 2019), the commercial realities of antibiotic development remained difficult. Many pharmaceutical companies struggled with the economics of anti-infectives due to pricing pressures, stewardship programs limiting inappropriate use, and the need to reserve new antibiotics for resistant infections. Several small antibiotic companies faced bankruptcy in subsequent years despite having FDA-approved products.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself did not contain explicit forward-looking predictions about outcomes. However, the implication that the division might be difficult to sell due to lack of differentiation and poor economics was validated in the immediate context of venture capital interest. The fact that AstraZeneca ultimately succeeded with a different buyer (Pfizer) at a substantial transaction value suggests the assets had more value than venture groups initially perceived, though the strategic rationale for a large pharmaceutical company differed significantly from what would appeal to venture investors.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **1/10**

While this article captures a specific moment in pharmaceutical portfolio management, it lacks broader significance for biotechnology developments or clinical outcomes. The core story is a straightforward corporate divestiture challenge with limited long-term importance beyond the specific companies involved.
