# An Alzheimer's IPO, Because Why Not (May 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes financier Vivek Ramaswamy launching Axovant Pharmaceuticals through an unconventional strategy: acquiring a shelved Alzheimer's drug candidate from GSK for $5 million upfront. The asset was SB-742457 (later renamed intepirdine), a 5-HT6 antagonist that GSK had previously tested in multiple Phase I and II trials before discontinuing development in 2012. Despite the drug's previous abandonment and the notoriously high failure rate of Alzheimer's treatments in Phase III trials—described as where "Alzheimer's compounds have traditionally gone to die"—Ramaswamy filed for a $172 million IPO before the drug had demonstrated Phase III efficacy.

The author expresses skepticism about this approach, noting that while the milestone payments to GSK (such as $35 million for US approval) seemed modest compared to potential Alzheimer's drug revenues, the fundamental challenge remained: overcoming the historical difficulty of getting any Alzheimer's treatment through successful Phase III trials. The article frames this as both an example of extreme optimism and a commentary on the state of the IPO market in 2015.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2015 IPO, Axovant proceeded with the Phase III MINDSET trial of intepirdine (now RVT-101) as an add-on therapy to donepezil for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. The results, announced in September 2017, were unequivocally negative: the drug failed to meet both its primary endpoint (improvement on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale) and key secondary endpoints.

The clinical failure had immediate and severe consequences. Axovant's stock price collapsed, dropping approximately 75% in a single day. The company subsequently halted development of intepirdine for Alzheimer's disease and restructured its operations. 

This outcome reinforced the broader pattern in Alzheimer's drug development: despite decades of research and hundreds of clinical trials, effective disease-modifying treatments have remained elusive. The 5-HT6 receptor antagonist mechanism that intepirdine represented has generally not proven successful in Alzheimer's disease. Multiple other companies had previously pursued similar approaches with comparable negative results.

Axovant eventually pivoted to other therapeutic areas, later changing its name to Sio Gene Therapies and shifting focus to gene therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. The company's trajectory exemplifies both the high-risk nature of drug development and the particular challenges of the Alzheimer's field.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction (implicit):** The article anticipated that Axovant's IPO strategy was overly optimistic given the historical failure rate of Alzheimer's drugs in Phase III.
- **Outcome:** ✓ **Accurate.** The drug failed decisively in Phase III, validating the article's skepticism about the likelihood of success for a compound that major pharmaceutical companies had already abandoned.
- **Bigger picture:** Alzheimer's drug development has continued to face extraordinary challenges. To date, the vast majority of late-stage trials have failed, with treatment options remaining limited to symptomatic management rather than disease modification.

**Prediction (implicit):** The IPO valuation of $172 million for a previously-shelved asset suggested market enthusiasm that might not align with clinical reality.
- **Outcome:** ✓ **Accurate.** The market correction following the clinical failure demonstrated that the initial valuation was indeed inflated relative to the asset's actual prospects.
- **Bigger picture:** This pattern has repeated in biotech, where early-stage enthusiasm and financing sometimes precedes rigorous clinical validation, leading to significant volatility when trials succeed or fail.

**Prediction (implicit):** If approved, the drug would generate substantial revenue that would dwarf the $35 million milestone payment to GSK.
- **Outcome:** ✗ **Not applicable.** The drug never reached approval, so this hypothetical outcome wasn't tested. However, the underlying assumption about Alzheimer's drug market potential remains relevant—approved treatments for this indication do have significant commercial potential, which continues to drive investment despite high failure rates.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article captures a telling episode in biotech history that illustrates broader themes: the tension between financial engineering and clinical science, the persistent challenges of Alzheimer's drug development, and the consequences when optimistic market narratives collide with empirical data.
