# A Room Temperature Superconductor? Well… (August 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article discusses a July 2018 arXiv pre‑print (arXiv:1807.08572) that claimed observation of superconductivity at ≈ room temperature in a composite of gold‑ and silver‑nanoparticle films. The author notes that such a claim is extraordinary and that the potential scientific and economic impact would be massive.  

Soon after the pre‑print appeared, a post‑doctoral researcher at MIT, Brian Skinner, posted a detailed blog analysis (arXiv:1808.02929) pointing out a striking irregularity: two magnetic‑susceptibility curves measured at different magnetic fields displayed *identical* noise patterns over a substantial temperature range, a pattern that can only arise if one data set was copied and shifted. The article treats this as a serious red flag, likening the situation to the infamous Jan Hendrik Schön fraud, and concludes that the claim looks dubious unless the authors can convincingly explain the duplicated noise.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑publication scrutiny and withdrawal** – The duplicated‑noise observation sparked intense discussion on Twitter, blogs, and in the condensed‑matter community. Independent groups attempted to reproduce the result but reported no evidence of superconductivity in similar Au–Ag nanostructures.  

In early 2020 the authors voluntarily **withdrawn** the pre‑print, stating that they could not reproduce the original measurements and that further work was needed to understand the material’s properties. No peer‑reviewed journal ever published the claim, and the work has not been cited as evidence of room‑temperature superconductivity in any subsequent literature.  

**Impact on the field** – The episode reinforced the community’s caution toward extraordinary claims lacking independent verification. It did not alter the trajectory of high‑temperature superconductivity research, which continued to focus on hydride systems under extreme pressure (e.g., H₃S at 203 K, LaH₁₀ at 250 K) and on engineered cuprate/iron‑based materials. No commercial or policy changes stemmed from the Au–Ag claim.  

**Reputation of the authors** – The lead investigators have continued to publish on nanomaterials, but the 2018 claim remains a footnote and is generally cited as a cautionary example of data‑presentation issues rather than a scientific breakthrough.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction in the article:** “If the result were real, the impact would be gigantic; however, the duplicated noise makes the claim highly suspect.”  
  - *Outcome:* The suspicion proved correct; the claim was retracted and never reproduced. No technological impact materialized.  

- **Implicit prediction by the author:** “Low‑probability claims deserve a hearing, but they must survive rigorous scrutiny.”  
  - *Outcome:* The claim survived only the initial hearing; rigorous scrutiny exposed a fatal flaw, leading to its dismissal.  

- **Prediction by the original authors (implicit):** The material would open a new class of ambient‑temperature superconductors.  
  - *Outcome:* No such class has emerged; subsequent research has not validated superconductivity in Au–Ag nanostructures at ambient conditions.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The story is a useful case study in scientific integrity and the importance of reproducibility, but it did not lead to lasting scientific or technological change. It remains moderately interesting for historians of science and for those tracking the sociology of high‑impact claims.
