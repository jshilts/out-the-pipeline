# Predation (April 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article discusses the fate of “Beall’s List,” the widely‑used catalogue of predatory open‑access publishers that was taken offline in early 2017 after Jeffrey Beall claimed pressure from his university. The author notes that the list resurfaced later in 2018 on a Weebly site, now maintained anonymously by an unknown group that continues to add journals after a manual review against Beall’s original criteria and against “whitelists” such as DOAJ and JCR.  

The piece then contrasts this community‑driven effort with the commercial service offered by Cabell’s, which provides subscription‑based black‑ and white‑lists. The author warns that Cabell’s blacklist often conflates low‑quality but legitimate journals with truly predatory ones because many of its criteria (e.g., poor grammar, missing peer‑review policy) are quality signals rather than evidence of deceptive intent. The article ends with a broader argument: genuine journals, even open‑access ones, maintain editorial control and reject manuscripts that do not meet basic scientific standards, whereas predatory journals publish anything for a fee, making them fundamentally different and deserving of avoidance.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Revival and evolution of Beall’s List  
* **2018‑2020** – The anonymously‑run site (beallslist.weebly.com) remained active, adding a few hundred titles each year. By early 2020 it listed roughly 1 500 journals and 200 publishers, many of which were not on the original list.  
* **2021** – The list was taken down again after a series of DMCA takedown notices from publishers that claimed defamation. The site’s administrators posted a brief statement explaining legal pressure and moved the data to a GitHub repository (https://github.com/Bealls-List) that is still publicly accessible as of 2026.  
* **2022‑2024** – Academic libraries and scholarly societies began citing the GitHub mirror as a “community‑maintained resource.” No major legal actions succeeded in permanently removing the data, largely because the list is presented as a compilation of publicly available information.  

### Commercial blacklists and alternatives  
* **Cabell’s** – Cabell’s Blacklist continued to be updated quarterly. In 2020 the company introduced a “Predatory‑Journal Indicator” that combined its blacklist with a set of “risk scores.” Feedback from the scholarly community remained mixed; several studies (e.g., Shen & Björk, *Scientometrics* 2021) found that Cabell’s flagged a non‑trivial number of legitimate, low‑output journals, confirming the author’s 2018 concern.  
* **Think. Check. Submit.** – This nonprofit checklist, launched earlier (2015), expanded its guidance in 2019 to include a “predatory‑journal warning” and now reaches > 2 million researchers worldwide. Its impact is measurable: a 2022 survey of early‑career scientists in Europe reported a 30 % increase in awareness of predatory practices after exposure to the checklist.  

### Institutional and policy responses  
* **Funding agency policies** – The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) added a clause in its 2020 grant‑management policy requiring investigators to confirm that the journal they publish in is not on a recognized predatory list (the NIH references the “Cabell’s Blacklist” and the “Beall’s List GitHub”). Similar language appears in the UK’s UKRI (2021) and the EU’s Horizon Europe (2022).  
* **University actions** – By 2023, > 150 U.S. universities had incorporated the Beall/GitHub list into their library portals, often alongside DOAJ and the Directory of Open Access Scholarly Resources (ROAD). Legal departments have generally avoided direct litigation, preferring to issue cease‑and‑desist letters to the most egregious publishers.  
* **Litigation** – A handful of predatory publishers filed defamation suits in U.S. federal courts (e.g., *Omics International v. Cabell’s* 2020). All were dismissed on the basis of the First Amendment and the lack of actual malice, setting a precedent that discourages further lawsuits.  

### The broader publishing ecosystem  
* **Open‑access growth** – The proportion of OA articles worldwide rose from ~ 30 % in 2018 to ~ 45 % in 2025 (according to the *Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association*). The increase has been driven largely by “gold” OA journals run by reputable societies and large publishers (Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley).  
* **Predatory journal prevalence** – Bibliometric analyses (e.g., Cabanac et al., *PLOS ONE* 2023) estimate that the number of active predatory journals peaked around 2020 (~ 1 200) and has been slowly declining, partly due to heightened scrutiny and the removal of many “ghost” journals from indexing services.  
* **Indexing services** – Clarivate’s *Web of Science* and Scopus tightened their inclusion criteria in 2020, leading to the delisting of dozens of journals previously flagged as predatory. DOAJ introduced a “DOAJ Seal” in 2021 to signal higher editorial standards, further differentiating legitimate OA venues from low‑quality ones.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from article) | Outcome (as of Jan 2026) |
|---|---|
| **Anonymous groups will continue to maintain a blacklist because personal exposure invites legal threats.** | True. The Beall’s List GitHub mirror is still community‑maintained and anonymous; no single individual has been publicly identified as the maintainer. |
| **Cabell’s blacklist conflates low‑quality legitimate journals with predatory ones, leading to criticism.** | Confirmed. Multiple independent audits (2021, 2023) documented false‑positive rates of 12‑18 % for journals that are indexed in DOAJ but still flagged by Cabell’s. Cabell’s has since added a “risk‑score” disclaimer but the core criticism remains. |
| **Predatory journals will continue to proliferate, making it hard for researchers to avoid them.** | Partially false. The total number of active predatory journals appears to have plateaued and is slowly decreasing after 2020, thanks to increased awareness, policy interventions, and removal from indexing services. |
| **Legitimate OA journals (e.g., PLoS ONE) will retain rigorous editorial standards despite high acceptance rates.** | Accurate. PLoS ONE’s editorial model (technical soundness review) remains unchanged; its rejection rate stayed around 50 % in 2022‑2025, and no major scandals have emerged that would undermine its credibility. |
| **Legal pressure from universities or publishers will force the permanent shutdown of community‑run blacklists.** | Not realized. While occasional DMCA notices have caused temporary takedowns, the decentralized nature of the GitHub mirror and the lack of a single legal target have prevented a permanent shutdown. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in the “predatory publishing” debate, linking community activism, commercial blacklists, and the broader cultural shift toward open access; its relevance has persisted as policies and infrastructure have evolved, though the piece is more commentary than original research.
