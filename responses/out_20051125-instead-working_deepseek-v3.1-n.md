# Instead of Working (25 Nov 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a brief personal blog post from Thanksgiving weekend 2005. The author, who works at a place they call the "Wonder Drug Factory," is staying home with their children while their wife goes shopping. The post is primarily a lighthearted recommendation of various science and medical blogs that readers can browse instead of working during the holiday weekend. These include TP With Page Numbers, Aetiology, Adventures in Ethics and Science, Politics and Ethics of Science, Nature Erratum, and Dr. Charles.

## 2. HISTORY

The blog post appears to be a casual personal entry from what was likely a science/chemistry blog (possibly "In the Pipeline" by Derek Lowe, given the reference to working at a "Wonder Drug Factory," though this cannot be confirmed with certainty). The blogs recommended were active in the mid-2000s science blogging community. Most of these blogs are now defunct or no longer regularly updated, though the science blogging ecosystem they represented evolved into a broader science communication landscape.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contains no predictions about biotechnology, drug development, or scientific developments. It is purely a personal anecdote with blog recommendations.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **1/10**

This post has essentially no relevance to biotechnology industry analysis, containing only personal commentary and blog recommendations unrelated to scientific developments.
