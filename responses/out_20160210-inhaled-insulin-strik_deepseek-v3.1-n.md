# Inhaled Insulin Strikes (Out) Again (February 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article analyzes Sanofi's decision to terminate its partnership with MannKind for Afrezza, an inhaled insulin product that had received FDA approval but failed commercially. Despite a deal worth up to $925 million in milestone payments, Sanofi ended the agreement in 2015 after incurring roughly €200 million in losses.

The core problem identified was that Afrezza offered no demonstrated clinical superiority over injectable insulin—its main selling point was simply needle avoidance. Additional challenges included worries about potential long-term lung effects, unfavorable pricing, and Tier III insurance coverage status. The article notes that MannKind claimed to have cash reserves sufficient only until mid-2016 and was seeking a new partner, though the author expressed skepticism about any company wanting to take on a product with such limited market appeal.

## 2. HISTORY
Following the article's publication, MannKind continued to face significant challenges:

**MannKind's ongoing struggles**: The company did not secure a major new partnership comparable to the Sanofi deal. Instead, MannKind took back full control of Afrezza marketing and focused on direct sales efforts with limited resources.

**Clinical and regulatory developments**: No major new clinical trials demonstrated Afrezza's superiority over injectable insulin. The FDA maintained approval, but concerns about lung effects persisted, requiring pulmonary function monitoring for patients.

**Market performance**: Afrezza continued to have minimal market penetration. By 2018, annual sales remained under $20 million—far below the levels needed for profitability. The product faced competition from improved injectable insulin formulations, insulin pumps, and emerging continuous glucose monitoring systems.

**Patent and legal challenges**: MannKind faced various lawsuits from investors and continued to struggle financially, implementing multiple reverse stock splits to maintain NASDAQ listing compliance.

**Pipeline failures**: The company's broader inhaled therapeutic platform did not lead to additional FDA-approved products in subsequent years.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made several implicit predictions that proved accurate:

• **MannKind would struggle to find a new partner**: ✓ Correct. No major pharmaceutical company stepped in with a substantial partnership deal after Sanofi's exit, forcing MannKind to market the product independently with limited resources.

• **Minimal market penetration at lower price points**: ✓ Correct. Afrezza never achieved significant market share despite various pricing strategies, with annual sales remaining negligible compared to injectable insulin markets.

• **The needle-avoidance benefit alone wouldn't be sufficient**: ✓ Correct. The market demonstrated that patients and physicians weren't willing to accept potential lung risks and higher costs purely to avoid injections, especially as injection technology improved.

## 4. INTEREST 
Rating: **4/10**

The article provides competent analysis of a specific drug development failure but addresses a niche topic with relatively limited broader implications for biotechnology. While it correctly identified factors driving commercial failure, the subject matter had moderate importance compared to more transformative biotech developments occurring during this period.
