# How Do Drugs Get Into Cells? A Vicious Debate. (April 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2012 commentary described a long‑standing controversy in pharmacology: whether small‑molecule drugs reach the interior of cells mainly by **passive diffusion** across the lipid bilayer or by **carrier‑mediated (active) transport** through membrane proteins.  

* The “classical” view, taught in most curricula, holds that both mechanisms operate—passive diffusion dominates for drug‑like molecules that obey Lipinski’s “Rule‑of‑Five”, while active transport can become important when a compound resembles a natural substrate or when a specific transporter is highly expressed.  
* A minority camp, led by Paul Dobson and Douglas Kell, argued that **carrier‑mediated uptake is the norm** and that passive diffusion contributes negligibly. They cited (i) the abundance of >1 000 human transporters, (ii) discrepancies between drug permeation in artificial lipid membranes versus living cells, and (iii) the poor correlation of simple physicochemical descriptors (e.g., log P, molecular weight) with brain penetration.  
* A rebuttal paper in *Drug Discovery Today* defended the conventional view, pointing to numerous examples of non‑saturable, concentration‑independent permeation, the well‑established utility of the Rule‑of‑Five, and the limited relevance of many “orphan” transporters to typical drug molecules.  
* The author of the commentary leaned ~80 % toward the critics, acknowledging that some transporters are indeed overlooked but rejecting the claim that passive diffusion is essentially irrelevant.

## 2. HISTORY  
**What has happened in the decade after 2012?**  

1. **Continued coexistence of both mechanisms** – The consensus in the ADME community has settled on a **dual‑pathway model**: most drug‑like molecules cross membranes primarily by passive diffusion, while a substantial minority (≈30 % of approved drugs) are recognized as substrates of clinically relevant transporters (e.g., OATP1B1/1B3, P‑gp, BCRP, OCT1/2). This balance is reflected in FDA and EMA guidance documents that require transporter interaction studies for new molecular entities.  

2. **Growth of transporter profiling** – High‑throughput assays for the major uptake and efflux transporters have become routine in early‑stage drug discovery. Companies now screen candidates against panels of >10 transporters to flag potential drug‑drug interaction (DDI) risks. The “Kell‑Dobson” call for systematic transporter evaluation helped accelerate this shift, even though the claim that *all* uptake is carrier‑mediated was not adopted.  

3. **Identification of previously “orphan” transporters** – Since 2012, several transporters once considered poorly characterized have been linked to drug disposition. Notable examples include **SLCO1B3 (OATP1B3)** for certain kinase inhibitors, **SLC22A1 (OCT1)** for metformin analogues, and **SLC15A2 (PEPT2)** for peptide‑mimetic antivirals. However, these discoveries have been incremental rather than revolutionary; the total number of transporters with confirmed drug relevance remains well below the “thousands” suggested by Kell.  

4. **Brain‑penetration research** – The blood‑brain barrier (BBB) field still relies heavily on physicochemical rules (log P, polar surface area) to predict passive diffusion, supplemented by **active transport** considerations for a limited set of substrates (e.g., LAT1‑mediated uptake of certain amino‑acid‑like drugs). PET imaging and in‑vivo microdialysis studies have shown that passive diffusion accounts for the bulk of CNS exposure for most small‑molecule drugs, confirming the critics’ position.  

5. **Methodological refinements** – The Caco‑2 and MDCK permeability assays remain standard, but their data are now routinely interpreted with **physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models** that explicitly separate passive and carrier contributions. The “discrepancy” between artificial lipid membranes and cells highlighted by Kell has been largely attributed to the presence of **tight junctions, membrane microdomains, and active transporters**, leading to more nuanced experimental designs (e.g., PAMPA‑GIT, parallel artificial membrane permeability assay with incorporated transporter proteins).  

6. **Regulatory impact** – The FDA’s 2017 “Guidance for Industry: Drug Interaction Studies – Transporter Substrate, Inhibitor, and Inducer” and the EMA’s 2020 “Guideline on the Investigation of Drug‑Drug Interactions” both codify the need to assess **both passive permeability and transporter‑mediated processes**. No regulatory body has adopted the “carrier‑only” stance.  

Overall, the debate has **tempered the extremes**: the field acknowledges that transporters can dominate the disposition of specific drug classes, but passive diffusion remains a fundamental, quantitatively important route for the majority of oral and CNS‑active small molecules.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not list explicit forecasts, but it conveyed two implicit predictions from the Kell‑Dobson camp and the opposing critics:

| Implicit prediction | What actually happened |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Most drug uptake is carrier‑mediated; many “unknown” transporters will be discovered that dominate drug disposition.** | A modest number of new drug‑transporters have been characterized (≈20–30 with clear clinical relevance), but they account for a minority of approved drugs. The claim that “most” uptake is carrier‑mediated has **not** been borne out. |
| **Passive diffusion is negligible for drug‑like molecules; physicochemical rules (log P, MW) are poor predictors of permeability.** | Physicochemical descriptors continue to be **highly predictive** for passive permeability and BBB penetration. The Rule‑of‑Five remains a cornerstone of medicinal chemistry, disproving the notion that diffusion is negligible. |
| **Incorporating transporter data will dramatically improve drug‑discovery success rates.** | Systematic transporter screening has **reduced late‑stage failures due to DDIs** and helped optimize exposure for several drugs (e.g., statins, antivirals). The impact is real but incremental rather than revolutionary. |
| **Artificial lipid membranes underestimate true cellular permeability because they lack protein channels.** | Experiments with PAMPA and other artificial systems have been refined (e.g., inclusion of cholesterol, membrane proteins) and are now understood to model **passive** diffusion only; they are not expected to capture carrier activity. The original criticism is now viewed as a **misinterpretation** of assay scope. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece captures a pivotal scientific dispute that shaped ADME practice over the past decade; its relevance persists, though the controversy has largely settled into a balanced view rather than a dramatic paradigm shift.
