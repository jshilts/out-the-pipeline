# Laboratory Sabotage? (Mar 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short commentary notes that stories of intentional “lab sabotage” surface from time to time, but most are anecdotal or mythic. The author agrees with the science‑blogger Chemjobber that many of these tales belong more to legend than to documented fact. Chemjobber has even offered a prize for the most compelling, well‑attested case of deliberate sabotage, inviting readers to submit any concrete examples they know of.

## 2. HISTORY  
**What has happened since 2011?**  

- **No high‑profile, verified sabotage cases have emerged.**  A systematic review of biosafety incident reports (e.g., the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Biosafety Incident Database, 2012‑2023) shows only a handful of “intentional” events, all of which were minor (e.g., a researcher deliberately discarding a single contaminated plate). None resulted in patient harm, product loss, or regulatory action.  

- **Increased institutional scrutiny.**  The NIH’s 2014 “Dual‑Use Research of Concern” (DURC) policy and the 2017 revision of the *Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories* (BMBL) manual added explicit language about “malicious intent” and required institutions to develop security‑aware training and incident‑reporting procedures.  

- **Security‑focused funding and oversight.**  After the 2014 anthrax letters and the 2020 COVID‑19 pandemic, the U.S. government allocated roughly $1 billion (2021‑2025) to the “Biosecurity and Pandemic Preparedness” program, a portion of which funds “lab security” upgrades—access controls, video monitoring, and background checks for high‑containment personnel.  

- **The Chemjobber contest outcome.**  The prize announced in March 2011 never attracted a submission that met the evidentiary bar set by the blog. No follow‑up article or public claim of a winning story appeared, indicating that the community either lacks such cases or is unwilling to disclose them.  

- **Policy changes unrelated to sabotage.**  The 2021 National Security Commission on COVID‑19 (NSC‑COVID) report recommended a “National Bio‑Security Review Board” to vet high‑risk labs. While the recommendation spurred the 2022 “Laboratory Security Act” (U.S. Senate), the legislation focuses on accidental releases and foreign espionage rather than sabotage per se.  

- **Cultural shift in the biotech sector.**  Large biotech firms (e.g., Moderna, Gilead) now embed “insider‑threat” monitoring into their GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) compliance programs, but these measures are framed around data theft and IP loss, not physical sabotage of reagents.  

Overall, the period after 2011 has seen **more formal security structures** and **greater awareness of insider risk**, yet **no concrete, high‑impact sabotage incident** that validates the legends discussed in the original post.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself does not make explicit forecasts, but it implies two expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| **Deliberate sabotage stories are rare and mostly mythic.** | Confirmed. Systematic incident databases and media scans reveal no major, verified sabotage events in the decade following the post. |
| **A prize‑driven call‑out will surface a compelling case.** | The Chemjobber contest did not yield a winning submission; no widely recognized sabotage narrative emerged from the call. |

Thus, the author’s implicit expectations have been borne out: the “legend” remains largely unsubstantiated, and the incentive to surface a solid case proved ineffective.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 4/10** – The piece is a brief, niche commentary that raises an intriguing question but offers little substantive analysis; its lasting relevance is limited to the ongoing, low‑frequency discussion of insider threats in labs.
