# Off-Label Promotion Is Legal, You Say? (December 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses a landmark court ruling in *United States v. Caronia*, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that off-label promotion of FDA-approved drugs is protected speech under the First Amendment and cannot be prosecuted. The case involved Alfred Caronia, a sales representative for Orphan Medical (later acquired by Jazz Pharmaceuticals), who was prosecuted in 2005 for off-label promotion of Xyrem (GHB). The court's 2-1 decision overturned Caronia's conviction and cited the earlier Supreme Court case *Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc.*, which had established commercial speech protections. The author notes this ruling contradicts longstanding FDA policy and industry understanding, as pharmaceutical companies had historically paid massive fines for off-label promotion rather than challenging the practice on constitutional grounds. The article anticipates that the FDA would likely appeal to the Supreme Court, leaving the ultimate legal status uncertain.

## 2. HISTORY
The *Caronia* decision marked a pivotal moment in pharmaceutical regulation, but its real-world impact evolved more gradually than initially expected:

**Legal Developments:**
- The FDA **did not** appeal to the Supreme Court, allowing the Second Circuit's 2012 decision to stand. This was somewhat surprising given the author's prediction.
- The ruling applied only within the Second Circuit's jurisdiction (New York, Connecticut, Vermont), creating geographic legal uncertainty.
- In subsequent years, the FDA shifted its enforcement approach rather than continuing First Amendment challenges. The agency began emphasizing "misleading" speech rather than the mere act of off-label promotion.
- Significant fines for off-label promotion **continued** despite the ruling. Major settlements occurred after 2012, including:
  - GlaxoSmithKline's $3 billion settlement (2012) for various violations including off-label promotion
  - Johnson & Johnson's $2.2 billion settlement (2013) for Risperdal off-label promotion to elderly patients
  - Novartis's $390 million settlement (2020) for off-label promotion of multiple drugs

**Regulatory Policy Evolution:**
- In 2017-2018, the FDA under Commissioner Scott Gottlieb signaled a more permissive approach, issuing guidance that allowed companies to distribute certain off-label information, particularly peer-reviewed scientific literature.
- The FDA created pathways for companies to proactively communicate off-label information through approved channels, reducing the need for covert promotion.
- However, the fundamental distinction between "informational" communication and promotional activity remained, and enforcement continued through fraud and misrepresentation statutes rather than pure off-label speech prohibition.

**Business Impact:**
- Jazz Pharmaceuticals (mentioned in the article as Xyrem's current owner) continued to market Xyrem aggressively and faced subsequent investigations, eventually settling a 2018 whistleblower lawsuit for off-label promotion for $57 million.
- The ruling did not eliminate off-label promotion enforcement but shifted the legal battlefield to questions of truthfulness and fraud rather than speech restrictions.

**Clinical and Public Health:**
- Off-label use remains widespread in medicine (estimated at 20-30% of prescriptions), particularly in oncology, pediatrics, and psychiatry
- No major public health crises emerged from increased off-label communication, though concerns about inappropriate prescribing persisted
- Physicians continued to have discretion in off-label prescribing, a practice that remained both legal and medically necessary

**Industry Response:**
- Pharmaceutical companies adopted more sophisticated compliance programs, focusing on ensuring any off-label communications were truthful, non-misleading, and evidence-based
- The "big fines" phenomenon continued, but with different legal justifications (fraud, kickbacks, false claims) rather than pure First Amendment challenges

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made one explicit prediction:
- **Prediction:** "I expect the FDA to try to take this to the Supreme Court, and it looks (to my non-lawyer eyes) like just the sort of thing they'd grant certiorari to. So I don't think this story is done"

**Outcome:** This prediction was incorrect. The FDA **did not** appeal the Caronia decision to the Supreme Court, despite the author's expectation. The ruling stood as a Second Circuit precedent, creating ongoing legal ambiguity but establishing important First Amendment protections for pharmaceutical commercial speech.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 8**

This article ranks in the 90th percentile for interest as it identified a watershed moment in pharmaceutical regulation that fundamentally changed the legal framework for drug marketing. The Caronia decision reshaped decades of FDA enforcement policy and continues to influence how pharmaceutical companies communicate about their products, representing a rare intersection of constitutional law, commercial speech protections, and healthcare regulation with lasting consequences.
