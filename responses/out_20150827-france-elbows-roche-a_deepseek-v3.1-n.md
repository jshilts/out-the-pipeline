# France Elbows Roche Aside on Avastin (August 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article describes the French government's decision to officially endorse the off-label use of Avastin (bevacizumab) for wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), rather than the significantly more expensive FDA-approved drug Lucentis (ranibizumab). Both drugs are anti-VEGF agents marketed by Roche and Novartis, with essentially identical efficacy based on clinical trial data. Lucentis had been the approved treatment but came at substantial cost to France's state health service, leading the government to explicitly direct physicians to prescribe Avastin off-label for wet AMD patients, making this cost-saving measure official policy after earlier temporary implementation attempts.

## 2. HISTORY
Following France's 2015 decision, the use of Avastin for wet AMD expanded significantly across Europe and beyond. While several countries and health systems adopted similar cost-saving approaches, regulatory and manufacturing concerns continued to limit universal adoption due to issues around the lack of ophthalmic formulation for Avastin and compounding pharmacy standards. Both drugs remained available, with clinical evidence consistently showing comparable efficacy but safety profiles that showed slight differences, mostly related to injection frequency and compounding practices. In 2022, the European Medicines Agency recommended a suspension of some intravitreal Avastin preparations due to manufacturing quality concerns at compounding pharmacies, leading to some reversals or restrictions in specific countries. The controversy highlighted broader debates about equitable access to expensive therapies and the tension between regulatory approvals and healthcare cost containment. While the annual savings for health systems remained substantial, the path was not uniform across all European countries, with Germany maintaining different approaches depending on regional health systems.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **"Expect more of this, especially if companies try to maintain positions like this one."**
  - This prediction was highly accurate. Following France's move, numerous other countries and health systems began exploring or implementing similar policies, and the pattern continues with high-cost drugs across multiple therapeutic areas. The biosimilar industry grew substantially after 2015, partly in response to these cost pressures.
- **"This is a price/efficacy battle that was lost some time ago"**
  - This assessment proved correct regarding this specific class of anti-VEGF drugs. Lucentis faced increasing pressure globally, and regulatory pathways evolved internationally with many countries allowing off-label Avastin use, with the debate shifting more toward manufacturing and safety standards than the core price/performance issue.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
This article captures a significant case study in access to medicines and government cost-containment policy that predates the broader biosimilars and drug pricing debates that intensified after 2015. Important early example of multi-country tension between regulatory standards and healthcare affordability.
