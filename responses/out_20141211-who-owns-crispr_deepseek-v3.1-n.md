# Who Owns CRISPR? (December 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article describes the intense patent dispute brewing in 2014 over ownership of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology. The author notes that CRISPR was clearly Nobel Prize-worthy and transformative, but a "vicious legal fight" was underway involving conflicting patent claims, multiple startup companies, and complex cross-licensing arrangements. Feng Zhang and the Broad Institute held what appeared to be the earliest and broadest patent coverage, particularly focusing on applying CRISPR to human cells—a claim that others in the field disputed since the technique seemed to work across all organisms. Academic labs were racing forward with large teams (like George Church's 30-person group at Harvard) despite the unresolved IP situation, while the technology continued evolving rapidly. The author predicted the dispute would likely end in court or settlement, driven by which CRISPR variants showed the most medical promise.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments resolved many of the 2014 uncertainties through a combination of legal decisions, scientific advances, clinical successes, and commercial maturation:

**Patent Resolution**: The key patent dispute between the Broad Institute (Zhang) and UC Berkeley (Doudna/Charpentier) was largely resolved by 2017-2022. The US Patent Office ruled in favor of the Broad Institute for use in eukaryotic cells, while UC Berkeley maintained patents for the basic CRISPR/Cas9 system. This led to cross-licensing agreements and the formation of separate commercial entities—Editas Medicine (Broad/MIT/Harvard), Intellia Therapeutics (Caribou Biosciences/UC Berkeley), and CRISPR Therapeutics (Emmanuelle Charpentier). The predicted court battles materialized but ultimately led to settlements and licensing frameworks that enabled commercialization.

**Nobel Prize**: The article's prediction proved correct—Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna received the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for CRISPR/Cas9, cementing the technology's historic importance.

**Clinical Translation**: The most significant post-2014 development was rapid clinical translation. CRISPR-based therapies entered human trials by 2016-2018, leading to the first approved CRISPR medicine: **Casgevy (exagamglogene autotemcel)**, approved by the UK MHRA in November 2023 and FDA in December 2023 for sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. This represented real therapeutic impact beyond laboratory promise—patients are receiving these therapies with demonstrated clinical benefits.

**Commercial Scale**: The three major companies (Editas, Intellia, CRISPR Therapeutics) became publicly traded, collectively valued at billions, with multiple programs in clinical development across blood disorders, cancers, and genetic diseases. The IP landscape evolved to enable both academic research (supported by licensing to Addgene and academic use agreements) and commercial development.

**Scientific Evolution**: The technology did evolve beyond the 2014 scope as predicted. Base editing and prime editing emerged as more precise alternatives, new Cas variants were discovered, and delivery methods improved significantly. These advances sometimes circumvented earlier patent claims while expanding therapeutic possibilities.

**Regulatory Milestones**: Beyond approvals, regulatory frameworks adapted to address CRISPR-specific concerns about off-target effects, germline editing (largely restricted), and manufacturing standards for cell therapies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Absolutely going to be the subject of a Nobel prize; I think it's pretty much of a lock"** ✓ **Accurate**. Charpentier and Doudna received the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

• **"Vicious legal fight going on over who owns the right to it... all this looks very likely to end up in court, or at least most of the way to court until the various parties can work out some sort of settlement"** ✓ **Accurate**. Extensive patent litigation occurred through 2017-2022, ultimately leading to settlements and cross-licensing agreements that enabled commercial development.

• **"The technology has still evolving, and may well evolve past some of the existing claims"** ✓ **Accurate**. Base editing, prime editing, and new Cas variants emerged that expanded beyond the original patent scope and offered improved precision.

• **"What will drive the whole process will be which CRISPR variants show the most medical promise, and that is yet to shake out"** ✓ **Accurate**. The first approved therapy (Casgevy) uses ex vivo editing for blood disorders, but multiple variants and approaches remain in development across different disease areas.

• **"Academic labs aren't waiting for the patent claims to get sorted out. Instead, they are racing to assemble very large engineering teams"** ✓ **Accurate**. Academic research expanded dramatically, with thousands of papers published and many labs adopting CRISPR tools while licensing frameworks supported continued research use.

• **Implicit timeline expectations**: The author seemed to anticipate quicker resolution—while settlements occurred, the full path to approved therapies took longer than might have been expected in 2014 (9+ years to first approval).

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 9/10**

This article captured a pivotal moment in biotechnology history with remarkable prescience, accurately identifying both the transformative potential of CRISPR and the complex IP landscape that would shape its development. The author correctly predicted the Nobel Prize, the legal resolution pathway, and the technology's evolution beyond initial claims, while the subsequent clinical approvals validate the article's assessment of CRISPR's fundamental importance.
