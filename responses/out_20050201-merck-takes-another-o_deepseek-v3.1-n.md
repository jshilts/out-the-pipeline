# Merck Takes Another One (February 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

This February 2005 commentary discusses a Federal Circuit court ruling that invalidated Merck's patent for the weekly dosing formulation of its osteoporosis drug Fosamax (alendronate). At the time, Fosamax was Merck's second-biggest selling drug, with the biggest seller Zocor facing patent expiration the following year. The court reversed a 2003 District Court decision that had found Teva's generic application infringed on Merck's formulation patent protecting weekly dosing until 2018.

The patent invalidation hinged on two key arguments. First, an obviousness challenge based on a 1996 trade publication discussing the desirability of weekly alendronate dosing. Second, a claim construction issue where Merck had defined "about 70 mg" and "about 35 mg" dosages in a way that the appeals court found internally inconsistent, essentially arguing that "about" meant "exactly." The court rejected Merck's attempt to act as "its own lexicographer," opening the door for Teva's generic competition years earlier than Merck had hoped.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2005 ruling, several significant developments occurred in the Fosamax/alendronate market:

**Generic Competition and Market Dynamics:** Teva Pharmaceutical launched generic alendronate sodium tablets in multiple doses after the patent protection eroded. The generic entry significantly reduced costs for the medication, with alendronate becoming widely available and affordable for osteoporosis treatment. Many other generic manufacturers also entered the market, resulting in typical generic pricing competition.

**Merck's Patent Strategy Outcome:** The Federal Circuit's decision stood, and Merck was unable to extend exclusivity on the weekly formulation. This loss was part of a broader pattern for Merck during this period, as the company faced multiple patent cliffs with major drugs. The Fosamax franchise continued to generate revenue but at significantly reduced levels due to generic competition.

**Fosamax Performance After 2008:** While exact post-2008 sales figures would require specific financial data I should verify carefully, the pattern for blockbuster drugs losing patent protection generally shows substantial revenue declines (typically 80-90% within the first year of generic entry). Fosamax likely followed this trajectory, with Merck continuing to market the branded version for some time while competing against multiple generic alternatives.

**Safety Profile Evolution:** In subsequent years, concerns emerged about long-term Fosamax use, including rare but serious side effects such as atypical femur fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw. These safety considerations became more prominent in post-marketing surveillance and clinical experience, leading to updated labeling and more cautious prescribing practices, though the drug remained an important tool for osteoporosis management.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit and explicit predictions:

• **Supreme Court review unlikely**: Correct. The Supreme Court generally does not take many patent cases, and this case did not present the fundamental patent law questions that would attract Supreme Court review.

• **Merck losing patent protection**: Correct. The Federal Circuit decision stood, and generic competition arrived substantially earlier than Merck's 2018 target, likely around 2008 when the original chemical matter patent expired.

• **Teva benefiting from the ruling**: Correct. Teva and other generic manufacturers were able to enter the market with alendronate products, capturing significant market share from the branded Fosamax product.

• **Continued trouble for Merck**: This was accurate in the broader context. During this period, Merck faced multiple challenges including the Vioxx withdrawal (2004) and patent expirations on major drugs like Zocor (simvastatin) in 2006. The Fosamax patent loss exacerbated these pressures.

• **The generics market expanding**: Correct. This case was part of the ongoing trend where generic manufacturers successfully challenged pharmaceutical patents, increasing access to affordable medications while reducing revenues for innovator companies.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This case represents a significant example of patent litigation dynamics in the pharmaceutical industry, illustrating how claim construction and obviousness challenges can dramatically alter market exclusivity timelines for blockbuster drugs. The article captures the tension between innovator companies seeking to maximize patent protection and generic manufacturers challenging weak patents to accelerate market entry.
