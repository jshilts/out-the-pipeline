# Phil Baran at Blog Syn (February 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses an incident where Blog Syn, a chemistry blog focused on reproducing published reactions, tested a benzylic oxidation procedure using IBX that had been co-authored by Phil Baran during his time in the Nicolaou lab. The reaction was successfully reproduced, but the process revealed that it wasn't as straightforward to execute as the original publication might have suggested.

Baran responded to Blog Syn's reproducibility check with a detailed experimental repeat, which the author praises as exemplary scientific conduct. The piece argues that public reproducibility testing is valuable and necessary, especially given broader concerns about the replication crisis affecting scientific research. The author notes that while some controversy exists around publicly rechecking literature reactions, Baran's civil and transparent response enhanced his scientific reputation.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2013 incident, several significant developments occurred in the reproducibility movement:

**Blog Syn's trajectory**: Blog Syn continued operations for several years, systematically testing and reporting on the reproducibility of organic chemistry procedures. By 2015-2016, the project had developed standardized evaluation criteria and contributed to a broader awareness of reproducibility challenges in synthetic chemistry. However, the blog became less active over time as its founders moved on to other projects.

**Phil Baran's career**: Baran became even more prominent in organic chemistry, receiving numerous prestigious awards including the ACS Award for Creative Work in Synthetic Organic Chemistry (2013), Mukaiyama Award (2014), and the Tetrahedron Prize (2019). He continued publishing high-profile synthetic methodology, often in prestigious journals including Nature and Science.

**Reproducibility movement expansion**: The broader reproducibility crisis gained increased attention. In 2016, Nature published a survey revealing that over 70% of researchers had tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments. Major initiatives emerged including the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology (2013-2021), which found that only about half of landmark cancer biology studies could be replicated.

**Chemistry-specific developments**: The chemistry community developed more systematic approaches to reproducibility, including detailed experimental procedures, digital supplementary information requirements, and initiatives like the "Reaction Procedure Verification" system. Some chemistry journals began requiring more extensive experimental detail submissions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions about the future:

• **"Public reproducibility is an idea whose time... has come, and Blog Syn is only one part of it"**
  - **Outcome**: Mixed. While reproducibility became a major topic across science with initiatives like the Reproducibility Project and numerous journal policies, Blog Syn itself became less active. The concept succeeded broadly, but this specific implementation did not sustain long-term impact.

• **"Prof. Baran's already high reputation as a scientist actually goes up a bit among the people who've been following this story"**
  - **Outcome**: Validated. Baran's reputation continued to grow significantly, and he became known for detailed experimental work. His career trajectory suggests this transparency-enhanced reputation contributed positively.

• **Implicit prediction that organic chemistry reproducibility would become less controversial**
  - **Outcome**: Partially validated. While systematic reproducibility efforts expanded, debates continue about the appropriate balance between trust and verification in the chemistry literature. The field adopted more rigorous documentation standards, but full public replication remains less common than envisioned.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captures an important early moment in the reproducibility movement's evolution, featuring transparent scientific engagement from a prominent chemist. While the specific IBX reaction discussion is narrow, the broader principles about reproducibility and scientific conduct have proven increasingly relevant across all scientific disciplines.

## 5. FACTS RESULT

• **Blog Syn**: Project continued for several more years but became inactive; helped establish reproducibility as a serious concern in organic chemistry
• **Phil Baran**: Career trajectory continued upward with multiple major awards and continued high-impact publications
• **Baran blog/site**: Likely inactive or defunct now (the original link is dead) but this format will fail
• **Reproducibility in science**: Became a major concern across disciplines, with institutions like NIH, NSF, and journals implementing new reproducibility guidelines
