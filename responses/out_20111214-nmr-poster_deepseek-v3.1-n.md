# An NMR Poster (December 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief 2011 blog post highlighted a useful educational poster-style presentation on proton NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy and spectral interpretation, created by Jon Chui. The author praised the visual learning resource as something that would have been valuable during their own NMR learning process, and recommended it as a helpful reference both for students learning the technique and for experienced practitioners who have been interpreting spectra for years. The post served primarily as a recommendation for an educational tool that made the complex topic of NMR interpretation more accessible.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following 2011, NMR spectroscopy continued to be a fundamental analytical technique in chemistry, biochemistry, and pharmaceutical research, though it faced increasing competition from mass spectrometry and cryo-electron microscopy for certain applications. The educational value of visual NMR resources like the one highlighted remained relevant, as NMR interpretation skills continued to be essential for chemists. However, the specific poster mentioned does not appear to have achieved widespread recognition or lasting impact in the broader scientific community. The rise of online learning platforms, YouTube tutorials, and interactive web-based NMR simulators in the subsequent decade may have diminished the role of static poster resources, though visual approaches to teaching NMR principles remain pedagogically valuable.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Prediction**: The author's implicit prediction was that this educational poster would prove valuable for students and experienced practitioners
- **Outcome**: While this may have been true for some individual learners who encountered it, there's no evidence this specific resource achieved broad adoption or lasting influence in NMR education

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 2** - This was a brief, niche educational resource recommendation with limited broader scientific or industrial significance. While potentially useful for chemistry students learning NMR interpretation, it had no major impact on biotechnology, drug development, or scientific methodology.
