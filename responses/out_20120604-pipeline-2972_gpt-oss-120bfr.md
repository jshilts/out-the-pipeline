# By Any Other Name (June 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short Xconomy‑style commentary laments the practice of biotech‑pharma companies re‑branding themselves, using Abbott’s 2013 spin‑off “AbbVie” as the prime example of a terrible name.  The author argues that “AbbVie” is meaningless, awkward to pronounce, and visually confusing (the double “b”).  He asks readers to nominate other companies whose names are not just boring but actually harmful to perception.

## 2. HISTORY  

**AbbVie’s formation and performance**  
- **2013 spin‑off** – Abbott Laboratories split its research‑based pharmaceutical business into a new, publicly traded entity named AbbVie.  The split was driven by strategic focus, not branding concerns.  
- **Blockbuster launch** – AbbVie inherited **Humira (adalimumab)**, which became the world’s best‑selling drug, peaking at > $20 billion in annual sales (2018‑2019).  The name “AbbVie” never impeded market uptake; physicians and patients refer to the product, not the corporate brand.  
- **Portfolio expansion** – AbbVie grew through high‑profile acquisitions:  
  * **Allergan (2020, $63 bn)** – added Botox, Restasis, and a pipeline of eye‑disease and aesthetic products.  
  * **Immunomedics (2020, $16 bn)** – brought **Trodelvy (sacituzumab govitecan)** for metastatic triple‑negative breast cancer.  
  * **AstraZeneca’s rare‑disease assets (2022)** – expanded the pipeline in hematology and immunology.  
- **Biosimilar pressure** – Starting 2020, the first Humira biosimilars entered the U.S. market, eroding Humira’s revenue by ~ $2 bn per year.  AbbVie’s response was to launch **Skyrizi (risankizumab)** for psoriasis (2020) and **Rinvoq (upadacitinib)** for rheumatoid arthritis (2021), both of which have achieved multi‑billion‑dollar sales.  
- **Financial standing** – As of FY 2025, AbbVie reported ~ $58 bn in revenue, ranking among the top 15 global pharma companies.  The corporate name has not been a barrier to partnerships, licensing deals, or investor confidence.  

**Other notable name changes (post‑2012)**  
| Company | Original name → New name | Year | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Biogen Idec → Biogen** | 2015 | Re‑branding to a simpler, legacy name; no measurable impact on R&D productivity. |
| **Celgene → Bristol‑Myers Squibb (acquisition)** | 2019 (acquisition) | Integrated into BMS; the Celgene brand was retired. |
| **Gilead Sciences → Gilead (no change)** | — | N/A |
| **Amgen → Amgen (no change)** | — | N/A |

The pattern shows that name changes are usually cosmetic and have little bearing on a company’s scientific or commercial success.  The most consequential “renames” are actually mergers/acquisitions that bring new assets, not the choice of a brand‑name.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

The article itself does not make explicit forecasts; it merely asks readers to suggest “the worst name.”  Consequently, there are **no specific predictions to evaluate**.  Implicitly, the author suggests that a bad name could be “harmful.”  The empirical record for AbbVie disproves that implication:

- **Prediction (implicit):** A confusing name would hinder market acceptance or investor confidence.  
- **Reality:** AbbVie became a multi‑billion‑dollar company, with a market cap > $200 bn (2024) and a robust pipeline.  The name has not been cited as a barrier in analyst reports or regulatory filings.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 5/10** – The piece is a light‑hearted commentary on branding rather than a substantive analysis of biotech science or market dynamics.  It is mildly interesting as a cultural footnote (the “AbbVie” name debate) but offers little lasting insight into the industry’s trajectory.
