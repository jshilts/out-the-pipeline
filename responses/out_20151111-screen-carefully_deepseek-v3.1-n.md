# Screen Carefully (November 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses a 2015 paper examining whether invalid bioactives can undermine natural-product-based drug discovery. The author emphasizes the problem of pan-assay interference compounds (PAINs)—natural products like quercetin, gossypol, berberine, genistein, curcumin, celastrol, and resveratrol that show activity in multiple screening assays due to their reactive functional groups rather than specific biological targets. These compounds typically contain quinones, polyphenols, or quinone methides that react promiscuously with cellular components.

The commentary highlights how these compounds can cause false positives through multiple mechanisms: covalent reactivity with sulfur nucleophiles, redox activity, aggregation under assay conditions, and interference with detection systems (fluorescence, luciferase). The author recommends an open-access book chapter by Dahlin, Baell, and Walters on assay interference as a comprehensive guide with counterscreening recommendations. The article stresses the importance of careful screening practices to avoid wasting time and resources on false leads.

## 2. HISTORY
The impact of this 2015 article and the broader PAINs awareness movement has been substantial and concrete in drug discovery practices:

**Scientific Adoption and Methodology Changes**: By 2016-2020, major pharmaceutical companies and academic screening centers had widely incorporated PAINs filtering into their screening workflows. The original Baell and Walters PAINs criteria (from their 2010 paper, expanded in the 2015 book chapter cited) became standard practice. Many screening facilities now automatically flag or exclude compounds matching PAINs substructures early in hit validation.

**Continued Documentation of Problem Compounds**: Subsequent research confirmed and expanded the list of problematic natural products. Celastrol, highlighted in the article for its quinone methide reactivity, continued to appear in multiple publications with varying claimed mechanisms, but no celastrol-derived drugs reached FDA approval due to the promiscuity issues. Resveratrol's story evolved with the 2016 revelation of data issues in some sirtuin research, further reinforcing the article's cautions about polyphenols. Curcumin specifically became a case study in problematic natural products, with multiple review articles published between 2017-2021 documenting its aggregation, redox activity, and lack of drug-like properties despite thousands of publications.

**Regulatory and Commercial Impact**: No major policy changes resulted directly, but the cumulative effect has been that funding agencies and pharmaceutical companies became more skeptical of natural product hits without rigorous counterscreening. Several natural product-based drug discovery programs were discontinued or redirected between 2015-2020, partly due to better understanding of PAINs liabilities.

**Research Tools and Databases**: The awareness led to development of computational tools (e.g., FAF-Drugs4, various cheminformatics filters) that help researchers identify potential PAINs compounds before experimental screening. These tools are now integrated into many drug discovery platforms.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not make explicit forward-looking predictions but rather warned about ongoing risks. The implicit warnings can be evaluated:

- **Warning about wasting resources on false leads**: This was well-founded. Multiple natural product programs continued to fail or produce irreproducible results through 2016-2020, with prominent examples in the polyphenol and quinone classes mentioned. Several companies and academic groups publicly acknowledged having to abandon projects after recognizing PAINs-related issues.

- **Implicit prediction that awareness would improve screening practices**: This largely came true. The period 2016-2020 saw widespread adoption of PAINs filtering in pharmaceutical screening, though some academic labs still struggled with the learning curve, evidenced by continued publications with problematic compounds.

- **Implicit expectation that problematic compounds would continue appearing in literature**: This proved accurate. Despite increased awareness, curcumin, resveratrol, and similar compounds continued to be published in hundreds of papers annually through 2020, often without adequate counterscreening controls.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 8/9**

This article addressed a foundational issue in drug discovery that had substantial practical impact. The PAINs concept fundamentally changed screening practices in pharmaceutical and academic drug discovery, preventing significant wasted resources and improving the quality of drug discovery efforts across the industry. The topic's importance is demonstrated by its continued relevance, with citations and discussions continuing years later in major journals and conferences.
