# Binding Assays, Inside the Actual Cells (April 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the "cellular thermal shift assay" (CETSA), a novel technique published in *Science* that enables researchers to measure drug-target binding directly inside living cells rather than in isolated protein preparations. The method extends the traditional thermal shift assay (which measures protein stabilization when a ligand binds) into intact cells by heating drug-treated cells, lysing them, and quantifying the remaining soluble target protein.

The key innovation is measuring thermal stability changes *after* drug exposure in living cells, providing a readout that accounts for cellular context—including membrane permeability, intracellular drug concentrations, protein-protein interactions, and post-translational modifications that cannot be replicated in vitro. The authors demonstrated CETSA with known drugs (methotrexate/DHFR, ralitrexed/TS) and highlighted its ability to distinguish real PARP inhibitors (olaparib) from the failed clinical candidate iniparib, which showed PARP inhibition in vitro but not in cells. The technique was also extended to whole animals, detecting target engagement in mouse organs after drug dosing.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2014 article, CETSA has become widely adopted in drug discovery and has evolved into a established methodology for measuring target engagement in cells and tissues.

**Scientific Adoption and Evolution:**
- The technique gained significant traction in pharmaceutical and academic research, with **CETSA now a standard tool** in many drug discovery programs for validating on-target activity.
- The methodology has been expanded to include **mass spectrometry readouts** (MS-CETSA), allowing **proteome-wide thermal shift profiling** rather than monitoring individual proteins via Western blot. This addressed the author's speculation about "measuring changes band by band" and enabled unbiased discovery of drug targets and off-target effects.
- Companies specializing in CETSA services emerged, and the technique became **integrated into standard drug discovery workflows** for hit validation, mechanism-of-action studies, and understanding drug resistance.

**Clinical and Drug Development Impact:**
- The PARP inhibitor example proved prescient: **olaparib (Lynparza)** received **FDA approval in 2014** for ovarian cancer and subsequently for multiple other cancers, becoming a blockbuster drug that validated PARP inhibition as a therapeutic strategy.
- **Iniparib**, the failed compound discussed in the article, **never recovered** despite attempts to reposition it. The drug officially **failed its Phase III trials**, and Sanofi eventually abandoned development. CETSA and related cellular target engagement assays became critical tools for preventing similar failures by ensuring compounds engage their targets in physiologically relevant conditions.
- Numerous **FDA-approved drugs** have since used CETSA or similar cellular target engagement assays during development, though specific examples are proprietary.

**Technical Developments:**
- Protocols were standardized and commercialized, with **antibody-based readouts** and **MS-CETSA** becoming the dominant implementations.
- The technique showed particular value in **cancer drug discovery**, **kinase inhibitor development**, and **PROTAC degradation studies**.
- Time-resolved CETSA variations emerged, enabling **kinetic studies** of drug-target engagement.

**Business and Commercial Impact:**
- The original Swedish/Singapore research groups continued advancing the technology, though I cannot provide specific company formation details with high confidence.
- The method became **embedded in standard practices** rather than spawning standalone companies, reflecting its adoption as an enabling technology across the industry.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Author's Predictions and Their Outcomes:**

• **"This CETSA technique is, of course, completely target-directed, unless you feel like doing thermal shift measurements on a few hundred (or few thousand) proteins. But that makes me wonder if that's something that could be done."**
  - **OUTCOME: PARTIALLY FULFILLED, EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS.** Mass spectrometry-coupled CETSA (MS-CETSA) has enabled proteome-wide thermal profiling, routinely measuring thousands of proteins simultaneously. This has become a powerful tool for target deconvolution, off-target identification, and mechanism-of-action studies—far beyond the author's tentative speculation.

• **"This CETSA idea very interesting, and well worth following up on. Time to look for a chance to try it out!"**
  - **OUTCOME: FULFILLED.** CETSA became widely adopted across pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, and biotech. It evolved into a mature, standardized technique integrated into drug discovery workflows globally.

• **Implicit prediction that PARP inhibitor validation mattered: The article highlighted how CETSA could have prevented the iniparib failure.**
  - **OUTCOME: VALIDATED.** Olaparib succeeded (multiple FDA approvals, major commercial success), while iniparib definitively failed. Cellular target engagement assays like CETSA became critical validation tools, preventing development of compounds that work in vitro but not in cells.

• **Concern about thermal shift assay utility in general: "In my experience, thermal shift assays have not been all that useful... often used for screening fragments, where the potencies are not very impressive, and... often broken out to be used on tricky targets."**
  - **OUTCOME: PARTIALLY MITIGATED.** While CETSA didn't eliminate challenges with weak fragment binders, its cellular context and evolution to MS-CETSA addressed many limitations of traditional thermal shift assays, making it much more valuable than the author's initial skepticism suggested.

• **Hope that the technique could work in drug discovery settings for real targets beyond the academic demonstrations.**
  - **OUTCOME: FULFILLED.** CETSA has been successfully applied across target classes, therapeutic areas, and has aided development of numerous drug candidates and approved drugs.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 8/10**

This article identified a genuinely important technology at an early stage—CETSA became a transformative tool in drug discovery, directly addressing the critical challenge of validating on-target activity in physiologically relevant cellular contexts. The technique's subsequent widespread adoption, evolution into MS-CETSA for proteome-wide studies, and tangible impact on preventing clinical failures (like catching iniparib-type issues early) make this both prescient scientifically and important practically.
