# Organic Chemistry on Mars (June 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2018 commentary reported the first definitive detection of organic‑carbon compounds in Martian mudstone drilled by NASA’s Curiosity rover. Using pyrolysis‑gas‑chromatography‑mass‑spectrometry, Curiosity identified a suite of molecules—thiophenes, benzene, small aliphatic hydrocarbons, thiols and sulfides—that resembled the pyrolysis products of terrestrial kerogen and of carbon‑rich meteorites. The author emphasized that “organic” in chemistry does **not** imply a biological origin and explored two competing explanations: (1) a **biogenic** source, i.e., ancient microbial life that left fossil‑like kerogen in a lake deposit; and (2) an **abiogenic** source, such as volcanic or hydrothermal synthesis, or delivery of carbonaceous meteoritic material. The piece also revisited the long‑standing debate over abiogenic petroleum on Earth and highlighted the puzzling, seasonally variable methane plumes observed in the Martian atmosphere, suggesting that both the organics and the methane could arise from either biological or non‑biological processes.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Continued organic detections  
- **Curiosity (2018‑2025)**: Re‑analysis of the original samples and new drill sites (e.g., “John Klein”, “Cumberland”) confirmed a broader inventory of organics, including chlorobenzene, dichloro‑alkanes, and nitrogen‑bearing compounds. The detections are robust against perchlorate interference because later experiments used the SAM instrument’s “EGA‑MS” mode with controlled heating rates.  
- **Perseverance (2021‑present)**: The SHERLOC and PIXL instruments have imaged and chemically mapped organic‑rich grains in the Jezero crater delta. While the instruments are surface‑focused and cannot perform bulk pyrolysis, they have identified aromatic and aliphatic carbon signatures consistent with the Curiosity findings, reinforcing the notion that organics are widespread in the near‑surface regolith.  

### Methane observations  
- **Curiosity (2018‑2020)**: Recorded episodic spikes up to ~7 ppbv, with a clear seasonal cycle peaking in the northern summer.  
- **Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO, 2018‑2025)**: Using its high‑resolution infrared spectrometer, TGO has **not** detected a globally uniform methane background above ~0.05 ppbv, contradicting earlier ground‑based claims of a ~0.5 ppbv background. However, in 2022 and 2023 TGO reported localized, transient enhancements (up to ~0.2 ppbv) over specific regions, suggesting that methane release may be highly spatially confined.  
- **Ground‑based telescopes (2020‑2024)**: Independent detections of short‑lived methane plumes (lasting weeks) have been reported, but the signal strengths are at the limit of instrument sensitivity, and the events have not been reproduced consistently.  

### Interpretation of the organics  
- The consensus in the planetary‑science community (as reflected in review articles 2020, 2022, and 2024) is that **the organics detected by Curiosity and Perseverance are most plausibly of exogenous origin (meteoritic delivery) combined with in‑situ synthesis driven by UV photochemistry and low‑temperature aqueous alteration**.  
- No compelling mineralogical or isotopic evidence for a biogenic signature (e.g., specific carbon‑13 depletion) has emerged from the rover data.  
- Laboratory simulations of Martian surface chemistry (e.g., UV irradiation of CO₂‑rich ices) have reproduced many of the observed molecules, supporting an abiotic pathway.  

### Abiogenic petroleum on Earth  
- Research on deep‑Earth hydrocarbon generation (e.g., serpentinization‑driven methane) has advanced, but the bulk of commercial petroleum and natural gas remains **firmly attributed to biogenic sources**. The abiogenic hypothesis is now regarded as a niche contributor, relevant only to specific geological settings (e.g., some mantle‑derived methane).  

### Policy and mission impact  
- The detection of organics helped justify the **Mars Sample Return (MSR)** architecture: Perseverance’s cached samples are slated for return by the 2033‑2035 joint NASA‑ESA campaign. The scientific community expects that high‑precision isotopic analyses of the returned material will finally resolve the biogenic vs. abiogenic question.  
- Public interest in “life on Mars” surged after the 2018 announcement, influencing funding allocations for the ESA‑Roscosmos ExoMars rover (now delayed to 2028) and for the Chinese Tianwen‑1 rover’s onboard instruments, which also reported organic‑related spectral features in 2021‑2022.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2018 article | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Organic compounds could be either biogenic or abiogenic; the question would remain open.** | Still open. As of 2026, the balance of evidence leans toward **abiotic/exogenous origins**, but definitive proof (e.g., isotopic biosignatures) is pending the Mars Sample Return. |
| **Methane shows seasonal variation and occasional plumes, hinting at active sources.** | Confirmed: Curiosity observed seasonal spikes; TGO detected localized, transient enhancements. The source remains ambiguous—possible subsurface clathrates, UV‑driven release, or rare microbial activity. |
| **Future missions would need deeper drilling or sample return to settle the origin debate.** | Realized: Perseverance’s sample‑caching and the planned MSR mission directly address this need. No rover to date has drilled deeper than ~5 cm (Curiosity) or ~7 cm (Perseverance). |
| **If organics were biogenic, Mars would have hosted a fossil record comparable to Earth’s kerogen.** | No fossil‑scale kerogen has been identified; organics are sparse and chemically altered, consistent with low‑temperature alteration rather than buried biomass. |
| **Abiogenic petroleum concepts might gain traction if Martian organics proved non‑biological.** | The Martian findings have **not** revived the abiogenic petroleum hypothesis on Earth; the hypothesis remains marginal, with most new research focusing on serpentinization‑derived methane rather than bulk oil. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 8/10** – The article captured a watershed moment (first confirmed organics on Mars) and framed a long‑standing scientific debate that continues to drive major missions and public fascination. Its relevance has only grown with subsequent discoveries and the upcoming Mars Sample Return.
