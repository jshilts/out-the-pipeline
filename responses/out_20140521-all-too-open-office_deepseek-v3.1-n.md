# This All Too Open Office (May 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article critiques the trend toward open-plan laboratories in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, focusing on dubious claims made by proponents of such designs. The author highlights an interview with architect Bill Odell of HOK, who argued that open-plan science buildings improve collaboration and adaptability, claiming that movable walls allow lab space to be converted to administrative offices as drug candidates transition from lab development to clinical trials. The author expresses strong skepticism about this conversion claim, noting that specialized lab infrastructure (hoods, air handling, utilities, shelving) cannot practically be converted to office space.

The article also questions the "generational differences" argument—that younger scientists prefer open environments while older scientists resist change—characterizing this as a recurring marketing tactic (dubbed "Dig the New Breed") used to push architectural trends. The author suggests cost reduction is the primary driver for open-plan labs, with collaboration and productivity claims being secondary justifications. The piece ends by noting the irony that while open-plan designs are promoted broadly, they rarely extend to executive workspaces.

## 2. HISTORY

The skepticism expressed in this 2014 article proved prescient as research on open-plan offices accumulated after the publication. Academic studies published between 2014 and 2019 systematically found that open-office environments often reduce, rather than enhance, productivity and collaboration. Key developments include:

**Research Evidence Against Open Offices:** A landmark 2018 study in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B by Ethan Bernstein and Stephen Turban of Harvard Business School tracked corporate employees before and after a shift to open offices, using digital badges to map face-to-face interactions. The research found that face-to-face communication dropped by 70% after the transition to open-plan offices, while email usage increased by 50%, directly contradicting claims that open offices enhance collaboration.

**Industry Realignment:** By 2017 to 2019, multiple major companies, particularly in the tech sector, began acknowledging that open-plan offices had failed to deliver promised benefits. Several conducted their own internal studies showing decreased productivity. While some biotech companies maintained open-lab concepts, the initial enthusiasm described in the 2014 article did not translate into widespread revolution in pharmaceutical R&D facility design.

**Lab-Specific Concerns:** The specialized infrastructure requirements for laboratories mentioned in the article proved a persistent constraint. Most biotech and pharma companies that experimented with flexible lab spaces found that while modular bench systems offered some adaptability, the fundamental infrastructure requirements for ventilation, utilities, and safety controls remained barriers to converting "lab space to administrative office space" as Odell described.

**Post-COVID-19 Impact:** The 2020-2022 pandemic dramatically shifted workplace dynamics. Open-plan offices faced criticism as potential transmission environments, while remote work became normalized in some functions. Biotechnology remained largely hands-on due to lab-based work requirements, but many administrative and computational roles shifted to hybrid or remote arrangements, altering the calculus for office space design.

**Mixed Adoption in Biotech:** The biotechnology industry largely did not experience a wholesale conversion to open-plan labs. Research-intensive companies continued building facilities with a variety of configurations, but the bold predictions about collaborative transformation remained largely unfulfilled.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article identified several predictions made by proponents of open-plan designs, which can be evaluated against subsequent developments:

• **"Younger scientists will drive adoption of open-plan labs because they work completely differently than older scientists"**: 
  - Reality: This prediction has largely proven false over the 2014-2024 period. High-profile studies consistently showed open offices reduce collaboration in practice. While generational differences existed in workplace preferences, the specific claim that younger scientists would embrace open plans has not been validated empirically.

• **"Lab space would be converted to administrative office space as drug candidates move from lab development to clinical trials"**:
  - Reality: This did not become a widespread practice in the pharmaceutical industry. The article's author correctly identified this as impractical due to infrastructure limitations. Most drug development facilities maintained separation between laboratory and administrative functions.

• **"Open-plan science buildings enable better collaboration and meet needs as science becomes more complex and multidisciplinary"**:
  - Reality: The evidence shows the opposite occurred across multiple studies. The 2018 Bernstein and Turban study demonstrated a 70% reduction in face-to-face collaboration in open offices, while digital communication increased. Other studies showed decreased productivity, privacy concerns, and increased distractions in open-plan environments.

• **"Any dislike of open-plan science buildings will fade over time"**:
  - Reality: Dislike did not fade; rather, understanding grew that the concept had serious flaws. Many companies modified open-plan workspaces by adding quiet zones, privacy areas, and modular elements after 2017 as employee feedback and productivity metrics showed detrimental effects.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates significant foresight by challenging popular trends and highlighting logical flaws in expensive architectural claims. The skepticism proved justified as subsequent research validated the article's concerns, particularly regarding collaboration claims and infrastructure limitations for laboratory conversions.
