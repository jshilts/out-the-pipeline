# The FDA's New Alzheimer's Guidance: Wonder or Blunder? (March 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the FDA's 2013 draft guidance for developing Alzheimer's therapies, which aimed to address two key challenges: demonstrating cognitive improvement in advanced patients and evaluating therapies in early-stage patients who show no cognitive impairment yet. The FDA proposed considering accelerated approval based on biomarkers as surrogate endpoints—measurable biological indicators that might predict clinical benefit—rather than requiring direct proof of cognitive improvement in early-stage trials.

This approach generated controversy. The New York Times editorial raised concerns about approving drugs with uncertain clinical benefits that could harm relatively healthy people over long periods. The FDA responded that it would only accept biomarkers if absolutely convinced they reliably identify patients whose early-stage Alzheimer's would progress to full dementia. Industry voices debated whether this represented a regulatory breakthrough or merely an acknowledgment that science wasn't ready—given that no validated biomarkers existed at the time that could reliably predict clinical benefit. The author concluded that regardless of interpretation, the guidance would likely channel more research funding toward biomarker discovery rather than direct clinical drug trials.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent decade after this 2013 guidance reveals a complex story of partial progress, massive failures, and evolving regulatory approaches:

**Biomarker Advancement**: The field did develop validated biomarkers. Amyloid PET imaging became widely used, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers like amyloid-beta 42/40 ratio and phosphorylated tau gained acceptance, and blood-based biomarkers emerged as screening tools. The **AT(N) framework** (Amyloid, Tau, Neurodegeneration) became the standard biological definition of Alzheimer's disease, enabling diagnosis even in preclinical stages.

**Clinical Trial Evolution**: Trials shifted toward **preclinical and prodromal** (early symptomatic) populations, requiring biomarker evidence of underlying Alzheimer's pathology for enrollment. The **DIAN-TU** (Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials Unit) and **A4** (Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's) studies exemplified this new paradigm, treating people years before symptom onset.

**Failed Drug Candidates**: Most high-profile late-stage trials failed between 2013-2019. **Solanezumab** (Eli Lilly, anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody) failed multiple Phase 3 trials despite showing some biomarker effects. **Bapineuzumab** (J&J/Pfizer) and **Gantenerumab** (Roche) also failed primary cognitive endpoints, though they reduced amyloid plaques.

**Aducanumab Breakthrough and Controversy**: In **June 2021**, the FDA granted accelerated approval to **Aducanumab** (Biogen/Eisai, brand name Aduhelm) based primarily on its ability to reduce amyloid plaques—essentially using amyloid reduction as the surrogate biomarker the 2013 guidance envisioned. This decision proved highly controversial because the two Phase 3 trials had conflicting efficacy results, there was no convincing evidence of clinical benefit, and serious safety concerns existed (brain swelling/bleeding in ~40% of patients). Three FDA advisory committee members resigned in protest, Medicare severely restricted coverage, and the drug achieved minimal market uptake despite approval.

**Lecanemab Validation**: In **January 2023**, the FDA granted accelerated approval to **Lecanemab** (Biogen/Eisai, brand name Leqembi) based on amyloid reduction, then granted full traditional approval in **July 2023** after the CLARITY AD trial demonstrated a modest but statistically significant 27% slowing of cognitive decline over 18 months. This became the first drug to show both biomarker effects and measurable clinical benefit. However, it still carries significant safety risks, requires frequent infusions and monitoring MRIs, and the clinical effect size remains modest (0.45 points on the 18-point CDR-SB scale).

**Donanemab**: In **July 2024**, the FDA approved **Donanemab** (Eli Lilly, brand name Kisunla) based on the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 trial, which showed a 35% slowing of cognitive decline over 18 months and allowed some patients to discontinue treatment after achieving amyloid clearance. This represents the third major anti-amyloid approval but follows similar patterns of modest benefit with safety concerns.

**Pipeline and Adoption**: As of 2024-2025, multiple anti-amyloid and anti-tau therapies remain in development. However, **clinical adoption has been slower than anticipated** due to high costs (donanemab priced at ~\$27,000 annually, similar to lecanemab), complex administration, safety monitoring requirements, and the modest nature of benefits. Less than 10% of eligible patients in the US were receiving these drugs a year after approvals.

**Regulatory Outcome**: The FDA did implement accelerated approval for Alzheimer's drugs as envisioned in 2013, but the pathway proved highly controversial for aducanumab and more accepted for lecanemab and donanemab. The agency maintained that amyloid reduction was "reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit," even when evidence remained weak, leading to ongoing debates about evidentiary standards and whether these drugs meaningfully help patients.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article discussed several predictions and potential outcomes. Here's how they compared to reality:

- **Prediction: FDA would eventually approve drugs based on biomarkers**
  - **Outcome**: Partially accurate. The FDA did approve aducanumab (2021), lecanemab (2023), and donanemab (2024) based primarily on amyloid biomarkers, fulfilling the pathway envisioned in 2013. However, aducanumab's approval proved highly controversial and lacked convincing clinical benefit evidence, while lecanemab and donanemab eventually provided clearer (though modest) clinical validation.

- **Prediction: Finding validated biomarkers would take years**
  - **Outcome**: Accurate. Amyloid PET imaging, CSF biomarkers, and blood tests became well-established over 5-10 years. Blood-based phosphorylated tau (p-tau217, p-tau181) tests emerged as screening tools around 2020-2023, enabling broader patient identification.

- **Prediction: More funding would go to biomarker research rather than direct drug trials**
  - **Outcome**: Mixed. Biomarker research indeed advanced substantially, but direct drug trials also continued at high volume. The clinical failures of many anti-amyloid drugs between 2013-2019 did not deter further investment; instead, trials shifted to earlier disease stages and incorporated biomarkers as entry criteria. Billions continued flowing to both biomarker development and clinical trials.

- **Concern: Approving drugs with uncertain benefit could harm relatively healthy people**
  - **Outcome**: Validated for aducanumab. The drug showed serious safety risks (ARIA-E brain swelling in ~35% of patients, ARIA-H bleeding in ~20-30%) with no proven clinical benefit in its Phase 3 trials. However, lecanemab and donanemab, while having similar risks, showed modest clinical benefits that some considered meaningful enough to justify treatment.

- **Implicit expectation: Industry would embrace biomarker-based approvals**
  - **Outcome**: Partially true. Industry did welcome the pathway, leading to accelerated approvals. However, the modest efficacy of approved drugs, safety concerns, and complex administration requirements limited commercial success. Market uptake remained low due to physician uncertainty, patient/family concerns, and practical challenges.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article presciently identified the central regulatory dilemma for Alzheimer's treatments and accurately anticipated both the pathway FDA would follow and the scientific challenges involved. The story of how biomarkers became central to Alzheimer's drug approval—and the subsequent approvals of aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab—validates the article's foresight while highlighting ongoing controversies about evidentiary standards and meaningful patient benefit that remain unresolved today.
