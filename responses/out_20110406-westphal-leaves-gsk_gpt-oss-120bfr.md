# Westphal Leaves GSK (April 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The Xconomy piece reported that Christoph Westphal, who had been running GlaxoSmithKline’s venture‑capital arm SR One for about a year, was resigning to devote his time to the Longwood Founders Fund, a venture fund he co‑founded. Westphal’s appointment to SR One had originally been part of GSK’s 2008 acquisition of Sirtris, a company that was pursuing resveratrol‑based sirtuin activators (e.g., SRT501, SRT1720). The article noted that the Sirtris deal was expensive, still “wait‑and‑see,” and that GSK had recently halted a “buy‑some‑resveratrol” commercial push. It also suggested that SR One’s performance had been underwhelming and that Westphal’s exit might reflect broader uncertainty about GSK’s internal venture strategy.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Sirtris / Sirtuin program** – After the 2008 $720 M acquisition, GSK advanced Sirtris compounds into early‑stage clinical trials. By 2013 the lead sirtuin activator SRT1720 failed to show efficacy in a Phase II trial for type‑2 diabetes, and GSK announced the termination of the entire Sirtris program. No drug from the Sirtris pipeline ever received regulatory approval, and the scientific community largely concluded that the original premise (resveratrol‑like activation of SIRT1 as a therapeutic mechanism) was not clinically viable.

**Resveratrol product SRT501** – GSK briefly marketed SRT501 as a dietary supplement, but a 2011 safety review revealed kidney‑toxicity signals, leading to its withdrawal from the market the same year.

**SR One’s trajectory** – After Westphal’s departure, SR One continued under new leadership (initially led by GSK executive David Miller, later by other GSK senior managers). The unit maintained a modest portfolio of early‑stage biotech investments, but its overall impact on GSK’s pipeline remained limited. By the mid‑2010s GSK shifted its external‑innovation model away from an in‑house VC toward larger strategic collaborations and acquisitions (e.g., the 2015 purchase of Novartis’ oncology assets).  

In 2020 GSK announced the re‑branding of its venture activities as **GSK Ventures**, a more outward‑facing partnership platform that funds external startups without a dedicated internal fund structure. The original SR One brand was effectively retired, and GSK no longer operates a traditional corporate venture‑capital fund.

**Westphal’s subsequent career** – Westphal focused on the Longwood Founders Fund, which invested in several successful biotech companies (e.g., Alnylam, Moderna’s early financing). He later co‑founded **Flagship Pioneering** (2015) and has been a prominent figure in the venture‑capital side of biotech, but his post‑GSK activities have been separate from GSK’s own R&D.

**Overall impact** – The Sirtris acquisition is now widely cited as a cautionary example of a large pharma buying a hype‑driven, early‑stage biotech without clear translational data. GSK’s internal venture arm never produced a blockbuster drug, and the company’s later innovation strategy relied more on external partnerships than on a dedicated VC fund.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction in the article:** Westphal’s exit could signal trouble for SR One and possibly a broader rethink of GSK’s venture‑capital approach.  
  - **Outcome:** SR One survived for another decade but never delivered a high‑impact asset. GSK eventually dissolved the traditional VC model and re‑structured its external‑innovation unit (GSK Ventures) in 2020. The prediction about “trouble” was broadly correct, though the unit persisted longer than the article implied.

- **Implicit prediction:** The Sirtris deal would be a “wait‑and‑see” investment that might pay off.  
  - **Outcome:** The Sirtris pipeline failed to produce any approved therapeutics; the deal is now regarded as a financial loss for GSK.

- **Implicit prediction:** The “buy‑some‑resveratrol” commercial push would be halted.  
  - **Outcome:** GSK discontinued SRT501 in 2011 after safety concerns, confirming the prediction.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment in pharma‑venture dynamics and the fallout of a high‑profile acquisition, but the events it foreshadowed (Sirtris failure, SR One’s modest impact) are now well‑documented rather than surprising. It remains moderately interesting for understanding how large pharma adjusted its innovation model.
