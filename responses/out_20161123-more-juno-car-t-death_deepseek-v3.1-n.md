# More Juno CAR-T Deaths (November 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a second round of patient deaths in Juno Therapeutics' CAR-T oncology trial (ROCKET study). Following three deaths that occurred in summer 2016 (which resulted in a brief 3-day clinical hold), two additional patients died from cerebral edema out of only twelve newly treated patients. The author questions whether the FDA should shut down Juno's entire clinical program given the repeated safety issues, and expresses skepticism that the ROCKET trial could restart. The piece raises concerns about whether Juno has adequately identified the root causes and risk factors for these fatal side effects.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent developments following this November 2016 article were significant:

**Immediate Aftermath**: The FDA did impose a clinical hold on Juno's ROCKET trial in November 2016. However, rather than abandoning the program, Juno worked with regulators and **restarted the trial in January 2017** with a modified protocol that included dose reductions and fludarabine removal from the preconditioning regimen.

**Clinical Outcomes**: Despite protocol modifications, **the ROCKET trial ultimately failed**. In March 2017, Juno announced they were discontinuing the JCAR015 program entirely after additional patient deaths, bringing the total to five fatalities from cerebral edema. The company pivoted to focus on other CAR-T candidates (JCAR017 and JCAR014).

**Regulatory and Corporate Impact**: Juno Therapeutics continued other CAR-T trials and was eventually **acquired by Celgene in January 2018 for approximately $9 billion**. JCAR017 (liso-cel) eventually received FDA approval in February 2021 as Breyanzi for large B-cell lymphoma.

**CAR-T Field Impact**: Despite Juno's setbacks, the CAR-T field advanced significantly. **Kymriah (Novartis) and Yescarta (Gilead/Kite)** received FDA approval in 2017, demonstrating cerebral edema wasn't a universal CAR-T toxicity. These approved therapies have treated thousands of patients with acceptable safety profiles, though cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity remain manageable complications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several predictions or speculations:

• **That the FDA might shut down Juno's entire clinical program**: ✗ **Incorrect** - The FDA issued only a partial hold on the ROCKET trial, not the broader program.

• **That the ROCKET trial likely wouldn't restart**: ✗ **Partially incorrect** - The trial did restart with modifications in January 2017, though it was ultimately discontinued in March 2017.

• **That Juno would need convincing data to address safety concerns**: ✓ **Correct** - Regulatory scrutiny remained high, and the modified protocol ultimately proved insufficient.

• **That other Juno trials might face similar risks**: ✗ **Incorrect** - Other Juno programs (JCAR017) proceeded successfully and eventually gained approval, suggesting the cerebral edema issue was specific to JCAR015's design.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captures a critical inflection point in CAR-T development, documenting early safety challenges that shaped the field's trajectory. The events highlight the complexity of balancing innovation with patient safety in cutting-edge cellular therapy.
