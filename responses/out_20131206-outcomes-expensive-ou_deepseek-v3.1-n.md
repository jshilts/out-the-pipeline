# Outcomes, Expensive Outcomes (December 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This 2013 commentary discusses the pharmaceutical industry's shift away from relying on surrogate markers (like LDL cholesterol levels or blood pressure readings) and toward "outcome studies" that measure actual patient results (like heart attacks, strokes, or death). The article references a Forbes column by John LaMattina highlighting that many reasonable-sounding biological hypotheses—such as combining blood pressure medications or aggressively lowering LDL—don't necessarily translate into better clinical outcomes. The piece emphasizes four key points: clinical trials have inherent limitations in predicting real-world effects; reasonable medical hypotheses aren't always valid; our understanding of human biology remains incomplete; and approved drugs remain "experimental" even after years on the market. The article also notes the enormous cost of proper outcome trials and expresses uncertainty about whether companies investing in such studies will be able to recoup their expenses.

## 2. HISTORY
Since 2013, the outcomes-based approach has indeed become more entrenched in drug development and regulation. The FDA has increasingly required outcomes data, particularly for cardiovascular drugs. The PCSK9 inhibitors (alirocumab and evolocumab), approved in 2015 for LDL reduction, faced intense scrutiny and initially limited uptake until large outcomes trials (like FOURIER and ODYSSEY) demonstrated actual cardiovascular benefit. The debate over ezetimibe crystallized these issues—while it lowered LDL effectively, questions persisted for years until the IMPROVE-IT trial showed modest benefit. The diabetes field saw similar evolution: whereas earlier approvals relied on HbA1c reduction, new therapies like SGLT2 inhibitors gained broader acceptance after major trials showed cardiovascular and renal benefits beyond glycemic control. The trend toward real-world evidence and the FDA's Real-World Evidence Program (launched in 2018) reflect this shift. However, costs remain substantial, often requiring 15,000-30,000 patients and costing hundreds of millions per trial.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Prediction**: Companies investing in expensive outcomes trials would face uncertainty about recouping costs.
  - **Outcome**: Partially borne out. Companies have increasingly pursued outcomes data, but willingness-to-pay and reimbursement policies have become critical, with payers demanding outcomes data for coverage decisions. For example, PCSK9 inhibitors faced reimbursement battles despite strong outcomes data.
• **Prediction**: Outcome studies would continue revealing shortcomings of approved drugs.
  - **Outcome**: Confirmed. Post-2013 examples include the withdrawal of indications for some diabetes drugs lacking cardiovascular benefit, and the recognition that several long-approved drugs offered less benefit than expected.
• **Prediction**: The trend toward outcomes studies would continue.
  - **Outcome**: Strongly confirmed. This became the dominant regulatory and development paradigm, influencing trial design, regulatory guidance, and payer requirements.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7/9**

The article identified a fundamental shift in drug development that accelerated after 2013, recognizing the inadequacy of surrogate markers and the need for large-scale real-world evidence. Its thoughtful skepticism about both scientific assumptions and economic viability proved prescient, making it more insightful than typical industry commentary.
