# What You Can Publish After a Shamectomy (December 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article highlights the proliferation of fraudulent "Stringer Open" journals—not to be confused with the legitimate Springer Open—as part of the predatory scientific publishing ecosystem. It references a ScholarlyOA blog investigation revealing that editorial boards were populated by fake identities (including a secretary who was unknowingly listed) and predicts these journals would be filled with papers from "dupes and/or con artists," particularly referencing the emerging market of Chinese papers-for-rent services.

## 2. HISTORY
The exposure of "Stringer Open" in 2013 occurred during a critical period when predatory publishing was rapidly expanding. In the years following:

**Regulatory and institutional responses:**
- The FTC filed its first lawsuit against predatory publisher OMICS in 2016 (FTC v. OMICS Group), resulting in a 2022 judgment requiring OMICS to pay $50.1 million in damages and cease deceptive practices
- Jeffrey Beall's "List of Predatory Publishers" (which included ScholarlyOA) became widely referenced until he shut it down in 2017 under controversy
- Major funders like NIH and institutions worldwide developed policies requiring researchers to publish in reputable journals

**Industry evolution:**
- In 2020, India removed over 12,000 fake journals from its UGC-approved list after a government crackdown
- Legitimate open access publishers strengthened quality controls, while bad actors continued adapting with new journal imprints

**Specific outcomes:**
- Authorship-for-sale services referenced in the article did continue operating; a 2023 Nature investigation exposed major paper mills selling authorship slots for $2,000-$26,000
- Retraction rates have steadily increased, with paper mill retractions growing from ~100 in 2012 to over 1,400 in 2021

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article's implicit predictions addressed the trajectory of predatory publishing:

- **Prediction**: Fake journals would continue proliferating and attracting "dupes and/or con artists"
  - **Outcome**: ✓ Confirmed. Predatory journals grew from hundreds in 2013 to thousands by 2020, with credible estimates suggesting they may account for 5-8% of total journal output

- **Prediction**: Paper mills ("Chinese papers-for-rent") would supply content to these outlets
  - **Outcome**: ✓ Confirmed. Systematic investigations revealed sophisticated paper mills creating fabricated research specifically for predatory journals

- **Prediction**: The "sleazy scientific publishing racket" would continue without intervention
  - **Outcome**: ✓ Partially confirmed. While the problem persists, regulatory actions (FTC lawsuit) and institutional awareness have created some accountability mechanisms

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 7**

This article represents early whistleblowing on predatory publishing that was just gaining momentum in 2013. While focused on a specific case, it captured systemic issues that would later become major concerns in research integrity. The relevance has only grown as paper mills have become more sophisticated and widespread, making this a prescient early warning.
