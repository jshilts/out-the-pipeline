# The Dover Decision Comes Down (December 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the landmark Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District decision, where U.S. District Judge John E. Jones III ruled decisively against the Dover, Pennsylvania school board's policy requiring intelligent design (ID) to be taught in science classes. The author quotes extensively from the judge's scathing opinion, which characterized the school board's actions as based on religious motives rather than legitimate science education. Judge Jones found that board members had relied exclusively on legal advice from organizations with religious missions (the Discovery Institute and Thomas More Law Center), failed to consult any scientists or science organizations, and gave "repetitious, untruthful testimony." The decision also noted that most board members admitted they didn't understand what intelligent design actually was. The ruling concluded that intelligent design was not science but rather a religious view that violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

## 2. HISTORY

The Kitzmiller decision had significant and lasting impacts on education policy and the broader evolution debate in the United States:

**Legal Precedent**: The ruling established strong legal precedent preventing intelligent design from being taught in public school science classrooms. To date, no subsequent court has reversed or undermined this precedent. The decision effectively ended attempts to introduce intelligent design into public school curricula through policy mandates.

**Policy Impact**: In the years following the decision, school districts across the country ceased pursuing intelligent design initiatives. State education boards avoided including ID in science standards. The ruling provided clear guidance that such policies would face constitutional challenges.

**Scientific Community Response**: Major scientific organizations (National Academy of Sciences, AAAS, National Science Teachers Association) consistently maintained their position that intelligent design does not represent legitimate science and continued to oppose its inclusion in science education.

**Discovery Institute**: The organization cited in the decision as providing legal advice to the Dover board continued advocating for intelligent design but shifted strategy away from direct curriculum mandates toward promoting "academic freedom" bills and questioning evolution through alternative approaches, with limited legislative success.

**Dover Community**: The Dover school board members who supported the policy were voted out of office in the subsequent election, demonstrating strong local opposition to the costly and divisive legal battle.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself made minimal explicit predictions, instead documenting the immediate ruling. However, the broader implications suggested certain expectations:

• **Continued Legal Challenges**: While the author didn't explicitly predict this, the tone suggested anticipation of ongoing legal battles. In reality, the strong precedent significantly reduced similar lawsuits, with no major repeat challenges achieving success.

• **Ongoing Debate**: The decision did not end the broader cultural debate about evolution education, as predicted by continued state-level controversies over science standards (though these shifted away from direct intelligent design inclusion toward other forms of skepticism about evolutionary theory).

• **Educational Impact**: The ruling successfully prevented widespread adoption of intelligent design in public schools, aligning with the judge's goal of protecting science education from religiously-motivated policies.

• **Community Response**: The local political consequences (board members losing elections) demonstrated that such policies could have electoral repercussions, a pattern that continued in other jurisdictions facing similar debates.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article documents a pivotal legal moment that shaped science education policy for nearly two decades, representing the intersection of law, science, and public education with lasting constitutional significance.
