# Roche / Genentech: So There is a Deadline (February 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief commentary article discusses Roche's tender offer for Genentech shares, which was set to expire on March 12, 2009. The article notes that Roche had previously claimed there was "no deadline" but had now revealed a cutoff date for the acquisition offer. At the time, there was significant disagreement between the two companies over Genentech's valuation and financial assumptions. Genentech's stock (ticker: DNA) was trading below $83, and the author expected Genentech would recommend shareholders reject the offer, putting pressure on Roche to increase their bid.

## 2. HISTORY

In the months following this article, **Roche successfully completed its acquisition of Genentech** in March 2009. After initially offering $86.50 per share in July 2008, Roche ultimately raised its bid to **$95 per share**, valuing Genentech at approximately $46.8 billion. The deal closed in March 2009, making Roche the full owner of Genentech (previously Roche owned about 56% of the company).

The acquisition was significant for several concrete outcomes:

*   **Drug Development Pipeline**: Roche gained full control of Genentech's extensive biologics pipeline, including blockbuster drugs like Avastin, Herceptin, and Rituxan, which remained top-selling cancer therapeutics
*   **Research Autonomy**: Genentech maintained a degree of research independence under the "South San Francisco" structure, continuing its innovative drug discovery programs
*   **Strategic Consolidation**: The deal allowed Roche to consolidate ownership of one of biotechnology's most successful companies during a period when large pharma was increasingly acquiring biotech innovators
*   **FDA Approvals and Market Impact**: Genentech continued to bring important drugs to market post-acquisition, including cancer immunotherapies and targeted therapies that became standard of care, generating billions in annual revenue

The acquisition proved strategically valuable as Genentech's biologics expertise complemented Roche's traditional pharmaceutical capabilities.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions about the acquisition process:

*   **Genentech would recommend against the offer**: ✅ **Mostly accurate**. Genentech's board did initially reject Roche's offer as inadequate, which aligned with the article's expectation
*   **Roche would likely raise their offer**: ✅ **Accurate**. Roche increased its bid from $86.50 to $95 per share to secure shareholder approval
*   **The acquisition would proceed despite initial disagreements**: ✅ **Accurate**. The deal ultimately closed, though it required negotiation and increased valuation

The broader biotechnology market context at the time involved ongoing consolidation trends, and many large pharmaceutical companies were acquiring biotech innovators to access novel therapeutic platforms and pipelines - a trend that continued in subsequent years.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article captures a pivotal moment in biotechnology history involving two iconic companies during a landmark $46.8 billion acquisition. The Roche-Genentech deal represents one of the largest and most consequential biotech transactions, with lasting impact on drug development and industry consolidation patterns.
