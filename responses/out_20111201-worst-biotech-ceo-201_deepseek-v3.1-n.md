# Worst Biotech CEO of 2011? (December 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief blog post from Science's Derek Lowe highlights Adam Feuerstein's "Worst Biotech CEO of 2011" reader poll, which was being hosted on TheStreet.com. Lowe encourages readers with strong opinions on biotech leadership failures to participate in the voting. The article essentially serves as promotional content directing traffic to the poll, without taking a position on specific CEOs or providing analysis of company performance, clinical data, or business decisions that might have justified poor ratings.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this 2011 poll, Adam Feuerstein's "Worst Biotech CEO" rankings became an annual tradition at TheStreet and later at STAT News (where he moved in 2015). These rankings garnered significant industry attention and often predicted or coincided with subsequent developments at the targeted companies. The CEOs and companies featured frequently experienced negative outcomes including clinical trial failures, regulatory issues, shareholder lawsuits, or delisting—though correlation does not imply causation. The polls became a barometer of investor sentiment and executive reputation, operating within the broader context of biotech's boom-and-bust cycles and the role of CEO accountability in capital-intensive, high-risk drug development. However, no systematic public policy changes or regulatory interventions resulted specifically from these rankings.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
This particular blog post did not contain explicit predictions about future developments, biotech trends, or company outcomes. It was purely a current-events commentary directing readers to a contemporaneous poll.

## 4. INTEREST
**2/9**

This ranks in the bottom 30% of interest because it's primarily a promotional cross-post with minimal original analysis or lasting scientific, clinical, or economic significance.
