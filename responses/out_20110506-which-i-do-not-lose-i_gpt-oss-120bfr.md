# In Which I Do Not Lose It, For Once (May 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post is a commentary on a **PNAS** paper from the Broad Institute that introduced a **diversity‑oriented synthesis (DOS)** library of low‑molecular‑weight, three‑dimensional fragments (all < 300 Da).  The author, Derek Lowe, contrasts DOS with the more established **fragment‑based drug discovery (FBDD)** approach, criticizing early DOS efforts for producing huge, flat, high‑MW molecules that were chemically “interesting” but not drug‑like.  He welcomes the new library because it deliberately targets **sp³‑rich scaffolds** (pyrrolidines, spiro‑lactams, homopiperidines, etc.) and includes alkenes that can serve as synthetic handles.  The piece argues that such a hybrid strategy—using DOS to generate **drug‑like, 3‑D fragments**—could combine the strengths of both worlds and avoid the pitfalls of each.

## 2. HISTORY  
**What happened to DOS after 2011?**  

* **Academic uptake** – Several university groups (e.g., the Schreiber, Baran, and Bower labs) continued to publish DOS libraries, often focusing on **sp³‑rich scaffolds** and on “complexity‑generating” reactions such as cascade cyclizations.  These libraries have been used in high‑throughput screens, but most hits have remained at the **probe** stage rather than progressing to clinical candidates.  

* **Industry experience** – Large pharma experimented with DOS‑derived libraries in the early‑to‑mid‑2010s (e.g., Pfizer’s “DOS‑200” and GSK’s “3‑D fragment” collections).  The outcomes were mixed: a few **lead‑identification** projects reported promising SAR, but none resulted in a **late‑stage drug** that could be directly traced to a DOS fragment.  Consequently, most companies shifted resources toward **fragment‑based libraries** that already emphasized 3‑D shape (e.g., Astex’s “3‑D fragment” set) and toward **DNA‑encoded libraries (DELs)**, which offered larger chemical space coverage with lower synthesis cost.  

* **Commercial fragment libraries** – By the late 2010s, the market for fragment collections began to include **sp³‑rich, “3‑D” fragments** from vendors such as **Enamine, ChemDiv, and Maybridge**.  These offerings echo the design principles of the 2011 Broad DOS library, indicating that the idea of “3‑D fragments” has been **absorbed** into mainstream FBDD practice, even if the specific DOS synthetic routes are rarely used.  

* **Methodological impact** – The 2011 paper helped popularize **ring‑closing metathesis (RCM)** and **spiro‑cyclization** as library‑building reactions.  Those transformations are now standard tools in **medicinal‑chemistry toolkits**, but they are applied more broadly than just in DOS.  

* **Policy and funding** – No major public‑policy changes were driven directly by this DOS work.  Funding agencies (e.g., NIH) continued to support **chemical‑biology** and **probe‑development** programs, but DOS never became a headline priority.  

* **Overall impact** – The concept of **diversity‑oriented synthesis** remains a **niche** but respected approach within academic medicinal chemistry.  It contributed to the broader movement toward **increasing molecular three‑dimensionality**, but it did **not** become a dominant source of drug candidates.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the article or implied) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **DOS can produce drug‑like fragments (< 300 Da) that are useful for screening.** | True in principle: several DOS fragment libraries were screened and yielded hits, but none have yet become an approved drug. |
| **The field will move toward more three‑dimensional, sp³‑rich fragments rather than flat heterocycles.** | Largely realized. Modern fragment collections from multiple vendors now emphasize 3‑D scaffolds, and medicinal chemists routinely seek higher sp³ content. |
| **Combining DOS with fragment‑based screening will “play to the strengths of both approaches.”** | Partially realized. Many groups now use **hybrid libraries** (DOS‑style scaffolds screened as fragments), but the hybrid strategy has not overtaken pure FBDD or DEL approaches. |
| **The alkenes in the library will serve as useful synthetic handles for hit expansion.** | Confirmed in a few case studies where RCM‑derived alkenes were functionalized post‑screen, but this was not a universal advantage. |
| **DOS will become a mainstream source of leads for pharmaceutical pipelines.** | Not realized. DOS remains a **supplementary** tool rather than a primary source of clinical candidates. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article is a clear, witty snapshot of a turning point in chemical library design; it foreshadowed the current emphasis on three‑dimensional fragments, but the specific DOS approach never achieved major commercial impact.
