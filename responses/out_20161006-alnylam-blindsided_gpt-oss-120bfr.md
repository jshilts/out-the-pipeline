# Alnylam Blindsided (October 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reported that Alnylam’s Phase III RNA‑interference drug **rivusiran** (ALN‑TTRSC), being tested for transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), was abruptly halted because an interim safety review showed a higher death rate in the treatment arm than in the placebo group. The deaths were largely cardiac, a known complication of ATTR, and the company had no clear mechanistic explanation. The piece emphasized the immediate market reaction (Alnylam shares down ~47 %) and the uncertainty this created for Alnylam’s other TTR‑targeting candidate, **patisiran**, as well as for the broader pipeline.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Rivusiran** – After the 2016 trial stop, Alnylam formally discontinued development of rivusiran in early 2017. No further clinical work on this molecule was pursued.

**Patisiran (Onpattro)** – The Phase III APOLLO trial continued despite the rivusiran setback and met its primary and secondary endpoints, showing a statistically and clinically significant improvement in neuropathy and quality‑of‑life measures for hereditary ATTR polyneuropathy (hATTR‑PN). The FDA approved patisiran in **August 2018** (brand name **Onpattro**), making it the first RNAi therapeutic on the market. Since launch, it has been adopted in the United States and Europe for hATTR‑PN and, after a label expansion in 2020, for hATTR cardiomyopathy.

**Next‑generation TTR RNAi** – Learning from the rivusiran failure, Alnylam shifted to a sub‑cutaneously administered, chemically stabilized siRNA (vutrisiran, formerly ALN‑TTR02). Vutrisiran received FDA approval in **June 2022** (brand name **Amvuttra**) for hATTR‑PN, confirming that TTR silencing remains a viable strategy when delivery and dosing are optimized.

**Broader pipeline and commercial growth** – Alnylam’s later RNAi products—**givosiran** (GIVLAARI, approved 2019 for acute hepatic porphyria) and **lumasiran** (OXLUMO, approved 2020 for primary hyperoxaluria type 1)—have been launched successfully, contributing to a market‑cap increase from roughly $2 billion in 2016 to >$30 billion by 2024. The company’s revenue grew from < $10 million in 2016 to > $1 billion in 2023, driven largely by Onpattro and its newer approvals.

**Industry impact** – The rivusiran episode reinforced the importance of rigorous cardiac safety monitoring in ATTR trials, influencing the design of later studies (e.g., stricter inclusion criteria, more frequent ECG and biomarker assessments). It also highlighted the risk of early‑phase mortality imbalances, prompting sponsors to adopt adaptive monitoring plans.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction in the article:** “The uncertainty … is hard to overstate … patisiran might run into the exact same problem.”  
  **Outcome:** Patisiran succeeded, received FDA approval in 2018, and has not shown a mortality imbalance comparable to rivusiran. The concern proved unfounded for this molecule.

- **Implicit prediction:** “A major dent in Alnylam’s pipeline.”  
  **Outcome:** While rivusiran’s loss was a setback, Alnylam’s pipeline ultimately expanded. The company secured multiple approvals (patisiran, givosiran, lumasiran, vutrisiran) and grew into a leading RNAi developer. The “dent” was temporary.

- **Implicit prediction:** “Investors need a good explanation … before the stock recovers.”  
  **Outcome:** Alnylam’s stock rebounded after the patisiran data were released (late 2016) and surged following the 2018 approval, reflecting restored investor confidence.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment—an unexpected trial failure that could have derailed a nascent RNAi field—but the subsequent successful approvals of patisiran and later RNAi drugs turned the episode into a case study in risk management and pipeline resilience, making it of lasting relevance to biotech analysts and scientists.
