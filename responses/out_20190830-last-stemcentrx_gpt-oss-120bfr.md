# The Last of Stemcentrx (August 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece reflects on AbbVie’s 2016 $5.8 billion acquisition of Stemcentrx and the subsequent collapse of its lead program, rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova‑T), an antibody‑drug conjugate (ADC) aimed at DLL3‑positive small‑cell lung cancer (SCLC). The author argues that the failure is “different only in degree, not in kind” from the typical 90 % clinical‑trial attrition rate in biotech. He highlights early investors (Artis Ventures, Founders Fund) who exited profitably, contrasts their luck with AbbVie’s loss, and cites Peter Thiel’s claim that Stemcentrx was built to make biotech “look more like a software company” with a higher probability of success. The article ends by reminding readers that, despite the hype, most biotech bets still end in disappointment and that the industry must simply keep trying.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑article developments (2019‑2026)**  

* **AbbVie write‑down (2019‑2020).** After the Phase III TRINITY trial of Rova‑T failed to improve overall survival in DLL3‑positive SCLC, AbbVie recorded a **$4.6 billion impairment** in its 2019 financial statements and announced it would **shelve the program**.  

* **Asset sale to Merck KGaA (2020).** In August 2020 AbbVie sold the remaining Stemcentrx assets—including the Rova‑T chemistry, the DLL3 antibody platform, and related intellectual property—to **Merck KGaA (EMD Serono)** for **approximately $1 billion**. The deal was framed as a “strategic divestiture” to recoup some of the loss.  

* **Termination of Rova‑T (2021).** Merck KGaA conducted a small Phase II study in 2021 but, after reviewing the data and the unfavorable safety profile (notably severe skin toxicities and off‑target effects), **discontinued development** of Rova‑T. No further clinical work on DLL3‑targeted ADCs has reached late‑stage trials as of early 2026.  

* **No approved products.** Neither AbbVie nor Merck has brought any Stemcentrx‑originated molecule to market. The company’s pipeline, which once included a CD47‑targeting antibody and a PI3K inhibitor, was either abandoned or folded into the acquiring firms’ broader programs, with no distinct commercial launches.  

* **Impact on M&A attitudes.** The high‑profile loss reinforced skepticism among large pharma about **mega‑acquisitions of early‑stage biotech**. In the years following, several firms (e.g., Roche, Pfizer) shifted toward **smaller, staged investments**—option agreements, milestone‑based payments, or “venture‑style” funds—rather than outright billion‑dollar buyouts of unproven assets.  

* **Venture‑capital perspective.** Early investors (Artis Ventures, Founders Fund) indeed realized **multiple‑digit returns** from their 2014‑2015 stakes, as reported in their fund performance disclosures. Their success is now frequently cited as a case study in **“early‑stage exit timing”** rather than a validation of the underlying science.  

* **Broader ADC field.** The Rova‑T failure contributed to a **temporary slowdown** in DLL3‑targeted ADC programs across the industry. However, the overall ADC market continued to grow, driven by successes such as **Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin)** and **Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan)**. By 2025, ADCs accounted for **≈ 10 % of new oncology approvals**, but DLL3 remains a **high‑risk target** with no approved agents.  

* **Regulatory and policy outcomes.** No specific legislative changes were directly tied to the Stemcentrx episode. The FDA’s **Project Orbis** and **accelerated approval pathways** continued to evolve, but the episode is more often referenced in **industry‑wide risk‑management discussions** than in formal policy revisions.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself makes a few implicit forecasts; they are listed below with the actual outcomes.

| Prediction (as implied by the author) | What actually happened |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Biotech companies will continue to have a ~90 % clinical failure rate, making large acquisitions “different only in degree.”** | The failure of Rova‑T and the subsequent write‑down confirm the high attrition rate. No Stemcentrx‑derived drug has succeeded, supporting the author’s view. |
| **Large‑scale “software‑style” biotech deals will not achieve a near‑certain success probability.** | AbbVie’s $5.8 B purchase did not yield a marketable product; the industry has since become more cautious about such “all‑in” buys. |
| **Early investors who exited before the failure will reap outsized returns, while the acquirer will lose money.** | Artis Ventures and Founders Fund reported > 10× returns on their Stemcentrx stakes; AbbVie recorded a multi‑billion‑dollar loss. |
| **The failure will serve as a cautionary tale but not halt the overall enthusiasm for ADCs or biotech investment.** | ADC development continued robustly, with several approvals after 2019; venture capital still poured billions into early‑stage biotech, albeit with more staged financing structures. |

No explicit quantitative forecasts (e.g., “the drug will be approved by 2022”) were made, so there are no direct mismatches to evaluate.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  
The article captures a pivotal moment in biotech M&A history and illustrates the stark contrast between venture‑capital exits and corporate acquisitions, offering lasting lessons about risk, valuation, and the limits of “software‑style” biotech models. Its relevance persists for investors, executives, and policymakers, though the narrative is largely retrospective rather than forward‑looking.
