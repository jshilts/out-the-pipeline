# Sir2 Surprise (November 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY 
This commentary discusses emerging contradictory findings about the SIR2 gene (and its homologs like Sirt1), which had been widely associated with lifespan extension through caloric restriction. The article highlights a provocative 2005 *Cell* paper from Valter Longo's lab showing that in yeast, **deleting** Sir2 actually extended non-dividing (chronological) lifespan—contradicting the prevailing view that Sir2 overexpression extends lifespan. Under caloric restriction and combined with IGF-1 pathway mutations, Sir2-deleted yeast lived up to sixfold longer.

Separately, Frederick Alt's lab found that deleting Sirt1 in mouse cells enhanced their replicative lifespan and resilience to oxidative stress, suggesting Sirt1 might act as a "checkpoint" that limits cell division under stress. However, whole-animal Sirt1 knockouts proved difficult to produce and had complex phenotypes. The author notes the fundamental contradiction: deleting Sir2/Sirt1 improved replicative lifespan in mouse cells but impaired it in yeast, while improving chronological lifespan in yeast—leaving the field puzzled about the underlying mechanisms and whether these findings would translate to whole animals.

## 2. HISTORY
Research on SIR2/Sirt1 and their connection to lifespan and caloric restriction continued intensively after 2005, though translation to human therapeutics proved challenging.

**Key developments:**
- **Sirtuins expanded:** The mammalian sirtuin family was characterized more fully, with seven members (SIRT1-7) identified, each with distinct cellular locations, targets, and functions including DNA repair, metabolism, and stress response (SIRT1, 6, and 7 are nuclear/ nucleolar; SIRT3, 4, 5 are mitochondrial).
- **Resveratrol and sirtuin-activating compounds (STACs) controversy:** The hypothesis that resveratrol (a polyphenol in red wine) directly activates SIRT1 became contentious. High-profile claims (e.g., that resveratrol mimicked caloric restriction) were later questioned. **Sirtris Pharmaceuticals**, co-founded by sirtuin researcher David Sinclair, was acquired by GSK for $720M in 2008, aiming to develop SIRT1 activators for metabolic and age-related diseases. However, subsequent trials for resveratrol and synthetic STACs failed to demonstrate significant efficacy in humans.
- **Clinical trial outcomes:** SRT2104 and SRT2379, SIRT1 activators from GSK/Sirtris, were tested in trials for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and inflammatory conditions, but results were largely negative or modest. No STAC has received FDA approval for age-related or metabolic diseases.
- **Nuanced roles emerge:** Longo's 2005 observation that Sir2 deletion extends chronological lifespan in yeast was followed by studies showing that sirtuins can have context-dependent, sometimes paradoxical roles. For example, SIRT1 can promote tumor suppression in some settings but tumor growth in others.
- **Ernestina Schipani's work and alternatives:** Later research by Schipani and others highlighted other pathways in caloric restriction (e.g., IGF-1, mTOR, AMPK) that intersect with but do not solely depend on sirtuins.

**Impact:**
- The initial enthusiasm that SIRT1 activators would rapidly yield anti-aging drugs did not materialize.
- Sirtuin research shifted from a "silver bullet" narrative toward understanding their complex, context-dependent roles in metabolism, DNA repair, and disease. Sirtuins remain biologically important, but they are not a simple lever for extending human lifespan.
- The commercial bet on STACs largely failed. GSK later wrote down the value of the Sirtris acquisition, and many STAC programs were discontinued.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Will Sirt1 knockout mice live longer, or not? What about under caloric restriction?**
  - **Outcome:** Whole-body Sirt1 knockout mice typically have **shortened** lifespans (e.g., Li et al., 2008). They show developmental defects and higher mortality, consistent with the article's note that "most of the mice don't survive" as knockouts. This suggests the earlier observation in isolated mouse cells did not translate to whole organisms.
  - Under caloric restriction, Sirt1 knockout mice generally still show pro-longevity effects, confirming that CR acts through multiple pathways beyond SIRT1.

- **Perhaps the two mechanisms [replicative vs. chronological aging] will fight each other to a standstill.**
  - **Outcome:** For whole mammals, the answer was clear: SIRT1 loss impairs healthspan and lifespan. The cell culture findings (enhanced proliferation) did not generalize to whole animals. In mice, SIRT1 generally promotes healthspan and metabolic function, contrasting with the surprising yeast data.

- **Implicit hope that SIRT1 activators would be anti-aging drugs for humans.**
  - **Outcome:** STACs like resveratrol and GSK's compounds failed in clinical trials. While sirtuins remain critical regulators of metabolism and stress, the idea that simply boosting SIRT1 would extend human lifespan or treat age-related diseases **was not validated**. The complexity—tissue-specific roles, dose effects, and off-targets—precluded a simple therapeutic strategy.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 7/10**

This article highlights a genuine surprise and contradiction that forced a re-evaluation of the sirtuin field. It correctly anticipated that resolving the yeast vs. mammalian paradox would be critical, and it documented early signs that the prevailing model was incomplete. Although the commercial and translational outcomes were largely negative, the scientific question it raised (context-dependent roles of sirtuins) remains relevant and led to a more nuanced understanding.
