# Ozonides As Drugs: What Will They Think of Next? (November 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary reflects on the surprising advancement of ozonide compounds as drug candidates, specifically focusing on arterolane (a molecule containing both an ozonide ring and an adamantane group) which was in Phase III trials for malaria treatment. The author admits his initial skepticism about ozonides as drug-like structures, having previously classified them as "Things I Won't Work With" due to safety concerns. The article notes that ozonides represent only a small structural step from artemisinin-derived endoperoxides (artesunate, artemether), which are established antimalarials, but acknowledges that getting past the psychological barrier of working with potentially explosive ozonides required significant scientific imagination.

## 2. HISTORY

After this 2009 article, arterolane (brand name: Synriam) progressed successfully through clinical development. In **2012**, India's drug regulator approved arterolane maleate + piperaquine phosphate as a fixed-dose combination therapy for uncomplicated *Plasmodium vivax* malaria. This represented the first ozonide-class drug to achieve regulatory approval. The combination therapy was subsequently introduced in India and some African markets for malaria treatment.

However, the broader adoption has been **limited geographically**. While the drug demonstrated efficacy, the combination has not been included in major international treatment guidelines such as WHO malaria treatment recommendations. Artemether-lumefantrine and other artemisinin-based combinations have remained the WHO-recommended first-line treatments. Arterolane-piperaquine found its primary market in India rather than achieving global deployment.

Clinical failures did occur within the ozonide class. **Artefenomel** (OZ439), another ozonide developed by Medicines for Malaria Venture and partners, showed promise in early trials but ultimately **failed** in Phase IIb studies, demonstrating that not all ozonides successfully translate to effective antimalarials.

The antimalarial field shifted focus around this period toward **combination therapies** to combat artemisinin resistance, which became increasingly problematic in Southeast Asia. While arterolane represented a novel mechanism, resistance concerns and the need for multi-drug regimens remained paramount.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction (implicit):** That arterolane's progress represented a breakthrough for ozonides as viable drug molecules

- **Outcome:** Partially correct. Arterolane did achieve regulatory approval (2012), proving ozonides could be developed into commercial drugs with acceptable safety profiles. However, it did not revolutionize antimalarial treatment globally, achieving only regional adoption limited primarily to India rather than replacing existing therapies worldwide.

**Prediction (implicit):** That the ozonide class would expand successfully into clinical use

- **Outcome:** Mixed. While arterolane succeeded, another major ozonide candidate (artefenomel/OZ439) failed in clinical trials, demonstrating that structural features beyond the ozonide ring critically determine success. The class did not see broad expansion with multiple approved ozonide drugs.

**Prediction (implicit):** That overcoming the "psychological barrier" of ozonide chemistry would open new therapeutic possibilities

- **Outcome:** Modest success. The ozonide mechanism proved viable for malaria but has not expanded significantly beyond antiparasitic applications. The field validated ozonide stability and safety in humans, yet this has not catalyzed widespread ozonide development across therapeutic areas.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article captured an important moment in drug development where a structurally exotic compound class overcame safety skepticism to achieve clinical success, demonstrating that chemical intuition has limits when predicting therapeutic viability. While the class impact was more modest than initially suggested, arterolane remains a significant example of antimalarial drug development.
