# Ten Years of Science Blogging. Already? (January 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a personal retrospective by a pharmaceutical industry scientist (Derek Lowe) marking ten years since he started his blog "In the Pipeline" in 2002. He reflects on being an early science blogger, possibly the first focused specifically on drug discovery. The author notes that industrial drug discovery blogging remained uncommon due to corporate constraints, but he was able to maintain his blog thanks to starting early and maintaining independence from his employers' official messaging. He reports steady growth in readership over the decade, with particular interest in posts about industry misery (layoffs) and his humorous "Things I Won't Work With" series, while patent/IP content tended to reduce engagement. The blog maintained consistent quality and tone, with comments sections exhibiting unusually high signal-to-noise ratios compared to typical blogs.

The author also observes that while the drug industry faced increasingly difficult conditions over the decade (with frequent layoffs), the fundamental R&D process remained unchanged—still following the traditional path of screening, lead optimization, medicinal chemistry SAR, PK studies, and phased clinical trials. He notes a significant transformation in scientific literature, which became more digital, interactive, and blog-like in its publication and discussion patterns.

## 2. HISTORY

After this January 2012 post, Derek Lowe continued blogging consistently for over another decade. His blog "In the Pipeline" maintained its position as one of the most widely-read and influential pharmaceutical industry blogs. The blog moved from its original platform to hosting by Science Magazine/AAAS around 2010-2011, and later transitioned to Science's "Corante" platform, before eventually becoming part of Science Translational Medicine's blog network.

Several concrete developments occurred:
- **Book publication**: His "Things I Won't Work With" series, mentioned in the article as being adapted for Kindle, did get published as a book, expanding his reach beyond blog readership.
- **Career impact**: The blog's success led to speaking engagements, consulting opportunities, and broader recognition within the pharmaceutical and chemistry communities.
- **Industry changes**: The pharmaceutical R&D landscape he described did undergo significant transformations, though gradual. The decade following 2012 saw increased focus on biologics, gene therapies (especially after 2012-2015), cell therapies (CAR-T approvals starting 2017), and accelerated vaccine development platforms (demonstrated dramatically during COVID-19).
- **Scientific communication evolution**: The trends he identified accelerated—preprint servers (bioRxiv launched 2013), open access mandates strengthened, Twitter/X became a major platform for scientific discussion (though declining recently), and substack/newsletter platforms emerged as alternatives to traditional blogs.
- **Blog persistence**: Unlike many early science blogs that ceased publication, his blog continued through 2024, maintaining regular posting frequency and industry relevance.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contains several explicit or implicit predictions which can be evaluated:

- **"Print journals have looked archaic for some time, and will likely continue their vanishing act"** - **ACCURATE**: This trend continued strongly post-2012. Most major journals transitioned to primarily digital formats, many ceased print editions entirely, and the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digital-first publishing.

- **"I haven't seen a hard copy of any of the journals I read in...months? Years?"** - **CONSISTENT WITH TREND**: This personal habit became industry standard. By 2024, most scientists accessed journals exclusively through digital platforms, and institutional print subscriptions became rare.

- **"Articles get published online, discussed online (shared, boosted, or picked apart), and their authors, their publishers, and their readers are paying attention to things like traffic stats, comments, and links. That'll continue, too"** - **ACCURATE**: Altmetrics, social media discussion, preprint commenting, and engagement metrics became standard parts of scientific publishing. Platforms like PubMed Commons (launched 2013, later discontinued), PubPeer, and Twitter discussions became integral to post-publication review.

- **"I think that science will be better off for it"** - **PARTIALLY ACCURATE**: While online discussion increased transparency and speed of communication, it also introduced challenges including misinformation spread, predatory journals, and polarization around certain topics. The net effect on science quality is debatable but the prediction of continued digitization was correct.

- **"For this blog? That's easier - I have every intention of keeping it going"** - **ACCURATE**: The blog continued for over 12 more years with consistent posting frequency, maintaining its voice and relevance in pharmaceutical industry discussions.

- **Implicit prediction about industry R&D remaining fundamentally unchanged** - **MOSTLY ACCURATE BUT OVERLOOKED BIOLOGICS SHIFT**: Traditional small-molecule drug discovery largely maintained the workflow he described. However, the rise of biologics, antibody-drug conjugates, and cell/gene therapies introduced fundamentally different development paradigms that don't follow the classic SAR/medicinal chemistry pathway he outlined.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

This article provides valuable historical insight into early science blogging and accurately captures the transitional period as scientific communication moved online, but much of its content is retrospectively obvious rather than presciently novel, limiting its long-term analytical interest.
