# Why Isn't There an ArXiv For Chemistry? (August 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary by Derek Lowe laments the absence of a chemistry‑focused pre‑print repository comparable to arXiv. He notes that physics and mathematics have embraced arXiv for nearly two decades, with thousands of monthly submissions and millions of downloads, while chemistry remains locked into traditional society journals (ACS, RSC, Elsevier, Wiley, etc.). Lowe points out cultural resistance in many fields—concerns about correctness, credit, and publisher relationships—that have slowed the uptake of non‑refereed sharing. He asks whether a chemistry pre‑print server launched in the early 1990s could have succeeded, and he predicts that the transition to modern, machine‑readable article formats (XML, interactive graphics) will be sluggish, especially in chemistry.

## 2. HISTORY  
**ChemRxiv launch and growth** – In 2017 the American Chemical Society, the Royal Society of Chemistry, the German Chemical Society (GDCh), and the Chinese Chemical Society jointly launched **ChemRxiv**, the first dedicated chemistry pre‑print server. By the end of 2023 it had hosted **≈ 35 000** pre‑prints and was receiving **2 000–3 000 submissions per month**. Submission rates accelerated after the COVID‑19 pandemic, mirroring trends in biology and physics.  

**Publisher attitudes** – Major chemistry publishers now allow (and in many cases encourage) posting of pre‑prints. ACS, Wiley, Elsevier, and the RSC have updated author‑guidelines to state that posting a manuscript on ChemRxiv does not constitute prior publication. Some journals (e.g., *Journal of the American Chemical Society*, *Angewandte Chemie*) explicitly list ChemRxiv as an acceptable venue for early dissemination.  

**Policy and funding mandates** – The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) have long required public access to peer‑reviewed articles, but they have also begun to accept pre‑prints as evidence of productivity in grant applications (2022 – 2024). The European Union’s **Plan S** (effective 2021) mandates that funded research be made openly available; many chemistry funders now list ChemRxiv as a compliant repository for the “pre‑publication” stage.  

**Adoption in the community** – Survey data collected by the Royal Society of Chemistry in 2022 showed that **≈ 45 %** of organic‑chemistry researchers had posted at least one pre‑print, and **≈ 20 %** reported that a pre‑print had led to a collaboration or a faster citation of the eventual journal article. The chemistry community still lags behind physics (≈ 80 % pre‑print usage) but the gap has narrowed substantially since 2011.  

**Formats and interactivity** – While PDFs remain the dominant format for final articles, many chemistry journals now publish **HTML‑plus‑XML** versions with interactive spectra, 3‑D molecular viewers, and machine‑readable metadata. ChemRxiv itself stores submissions in PDF and LaTeX source, and it provides **DOI‑minted** records that are indexed by Crossref, enabling citation tracking and linking to later peer‑reviewed versions.  

**Other chemistry‑related pre‑print venues** – In addition to ChemRxiv, platforms such as **bioRxiv** (chemical‑biology papers), **arXiv’s “physics.chem‑ph”** category, and commercial services like **Research Square** and **Preprints.org** have accepted chemistry manuscripts, further diversifying the ecosystem.  

**Impact on publishing business** – The rise of pre‑prints has not displaced traditional chemistry journals; subscription revenues remain robust. However, publishers have responded by offering **“fast‑track”** peer‑review services for pre‑printed manuscripts and by integrating pre‑print links into article pages, thereby preserving relevance while embracing open‑science workflows.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** *“If someone had started such a thing back in the early 1990s, would it (could it) have taken off?”*  
  - **Outcome:** The first chemistry‑specific pre‑print server (ChemRxiv) launched **26 years later** (2017). Its eventual uptake shows that a pre‑print service **can** succeed, but the early‑1990s environment—limited broadband, weaker open‑access mandates, and stronger publisher control—likely would have prevented rapid adoption.  

- **Prediction:** *“The transition to article formats and features better suited to modern technology … has been surprisingly slow.”*  
  - **Outcome:** As of 2025, PDFs still dominate final article PDFs, but **HTML/XML** with interactive figures is now standard for most major chemistry journals (ACS, RSC, Wiley). The pace is faster than in 2011, yet the “slow” characterization remains accurate relative to the potential of fully semantic, machine‑readable publications.  

- **Implicit prediction:** *Chemistry will remain “very much dominated” by societies and commercial publishers.*  
  - **Outcome:** Societies still control flagship journals, but **pre‑print acceptance** and **open‑access agreements** have eroded the monopoly on dissemination. The landscape is more pluralistic than in 2011, though societies retain significant influence.  

- **Implicit prediction:** *Researchers in chemistry would be reluctant to share unrefereed work.*  
  - **Outcome:** Survey evidence from 2022–2024 shows a **steady increase** in willingness to post pre‑prints, especially among early‑career scientists. Reluctance persists in some sub‑fields (e.g., crystallography with proprietary data), but the overall trend contradicts the earlier expectation of pervasive hesitancy.  

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article raises a clear, forward‑looking question about scientific communication that proved prescient; the eventual emergence of ChemRxiv and the broader shift toward open pre‑prints make it highly relevant, though the piece is more of a commentary than a data‑driven analysis.
