# Threshold Goes Under the Threshold (December 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses the Phase III clinical trial failure of evofosfamide (TH-302), a hypoxia-activated prodrug developed by Threshold Pharmaceuticals in partnership with Merck KGaA. The drug was designed as a nitrogen mustard chemotherapy agent that would only release its active form in low-oxygen environments, which are common in solid tumors like pancreatic cancer. The compound had received FDA fast-track designation for advanced pancreatic cancer, and the company's stock had traded in the $4-8 range following their development deal with Merck KGaA.

## 2. HISTORY
The MAESTRO Phase III trial results, announced in December 2015, showed that evofosfamide failed to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in overall survival for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer when combined with gemcitabine compared to gemcitabine alone. Subsequent to this failure, Merck KGaA terminated the partnership agreement in January 2016. 

Threshold Pharmaceuticals attempted to continue development with other trials, including a Phase II study in soft tissue sarcoma, but ultimately pivoted away from evofosfamide. The company continued to face financial difficulties and eventually merged with Cell Therapeutics in November 2016, forming a new entity called CTI BioPharma. CTI BioPharma later shifted its focus to pacritinib for myelofibrosis treatment, which received FDA approval in February 2022.

No FDA-approved drugs emerged from the evofosfamide program. The hypoxia-activated prodrug approach, while scientifically plausible, did not translate into clinical success for this specific compound.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Explicit predictions in the article**: The author did not make explicit forward-looking predictions about specific outcomes, instead focusing on the demonstrated failure and cautioning against investment in Phase II oncology companies based on this example.
- **Implicit expectations**: The underlying assumption was that Threshold Pharmaceuticals would face severe consequences from the trial failure, which did occur - the company's stock collapsed and it eventually merged with another company.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 3**

This article serves as a cautionary example of Phase III oncology trial failures, illustrating the gap between mechanistic plausibility and clinical efficacy, but represents a routine case of drug development failure rather than a landmark event.
