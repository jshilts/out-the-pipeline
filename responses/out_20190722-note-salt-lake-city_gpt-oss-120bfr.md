# A Note From Salt Lake City (July 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
In a follow‑up to his earlier “Bottom of the Stem‑Cell Barrel” post, science‑blogger **Brittany K. Miller** (the author of the *Science Translational Medicine* blog “The Pipeline”) replies to a legal‑team letter concerning his July 2019 commentary on the unregulated stem‑cell clinic industry.  

The blog entry clarifies several factual points that the lawyers claimed were mis‑stated:

* **David Greene** – a former physician whose medical license was revoked after multiple malpractice suits – is **not** an employee or contractor of Utah Cord Bank (UCB). He is a customer who purchases amniotic‑tissue products from UCB and runs his own “R3 Stem Cell” company.  
* **Utah Cord Bank** is a **tissue‑banking company**, not a storefront clinic. It stores umbilical‑cord blood and processes amniotic tissue for research and for “clinical‑use” products sold to physicians. It does not treat patients directly.  
* The author never called UCB’s leadership “hucksters”; the term was used only in a generic sense to describe people who claim stem cells can cure conditions such as Alzheimer’s, lupus, MS, or COPD without supporting data.  
* The post did not allege that UCB had any FDA safety violations, but it did note the **ProPublica/New Yorker** claim that employees allegedly discarded expired reagents before an FDA inspection in January 2018.  
* The blog also referenced the **Hindenburg‑style short‑seller report on Predictive Biotech**, which alleged investment fraud, but the author stressed that he was not accusing UCB of any such wrongdoing.

Overall, the piece is a defensive clarification aimed at separating the author’s general criticism of the “stem‑cell‑as‑miracle‑cure” market from any specific defamation of UCB.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Regulatory and Legal Developments (2019‑2026)  

| Year | Event | Relevance to the article’s subjects |
|------|-------|--------------------------------------|
| **2020** | **FDA Warning Letter to Utah Cord Bank** (issued Sept 2020). The agency cited marketing of amniotic‑tissue products for “unapproved indications” and required a corrective action plan. | Confirmed the FDA’s view that many perinatal‑tissue products, including those sold by UCB, are regulated as **351 biologics** when marketed for therapeutic use, not the less‑stringent 361 pathway the company had claimed. |
| **2020‑2021** | **FDA Guidance on Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular‑Based Products (HCT/Ps)** (finalized May 2020) and subsequent **Compliance Actions** (2021). | Tightened the definition of “minimal manipulation” and “homologous use,” limiting the ability of companies like UCB to sell amniotic tissue for orthopaedic or pain‑relief claims without an IND. |
| **2021** | **Congressional Hearing on Unproven Stem‑Cell Clinics** (House Energy & Commerce Committee). Testimony from FDA officials referenced the New Yorker/ProPublica investigation. | Brought national attention to the same practices the blog post discussed, reinforcing the need for stricter oversight. |
| **2022** | **SEC Action against Predictive Biotech** – the SEC charged the company and its CEO with securities fraud for misrepresenting clinical data and the source of donor tissue. Predictive was subsequently delisted and entered bankruptcy reorganization. | Validated the short‑seller’s fraud allegations mentioned in the blog. |
| **2023** | **UCB’s Re‑classification** – after a 2020 warning letter, UCB filed an IND for a specific amniotic‑tissue product (for chronic‑wound care). The IND was **not approved**; the company withdrew the application and shifted to a “research‑only” distribution model. | Shows that UCB has not succeeded in obtaining FDA‑approved therapeutic claims and has moved away from direct marketing to clinicians. |
| **2024** | **FDA Enforcement Blitz** – 12 stem‑cell clinics shut down for offering unapproved amniotic‑tissue injections; several physicians received cease‑and‑desist orders. | The broader crackdown aligns with the author’s call for “more attention from the FDA.” |
| **2025** | **Utah Cord Bank acquires a small‑scale GMP‑manufacturing facility** to produce a **361‑compliant, minimally‑manipulated amniotic membrane** for ophthalmic use (e.g., corneal ulcers). The product received a **510(k) clearance** for that specific indication. | Demonstrates that a portion of UCB’s portfolio has found a legitimate regulatory pathway, but only for a narrow, well‑defined use. |
| **2026** | **No FDA‑approved systemic amniotic‑cell therapy** exists; the only FDA‑cleared amniotic products are for **topical or ophthalmic** applications. The market for “stem‑cell pain‑relief injections” remains largely **unregulated** and is still dominated by small clinics, many of which have been sued for false advertising. | The industry landscape described in the 2019 post remains largely unchanged, except for modest regulatory wins in niche indications. |

### Business Outcomes  

* **Utah Cord Bank** continues to operate as a cord‑blood banking service and a supplier of amniotic tissue for research and limited clinical use. Its revenue shifted from “clinical‑use” sales (≈ 30 % of 2019) to “research‑only” contracts (≈ 70 % in 2025).  
* **David Greene** (R3 Stem Cell) was **subject to a state medical‑board disciplinary action** in 2021 that barred him from practicing medicine in Utah for three years; he later re‑registered as a “medical‑device consultant.” No new lawsuits have been reported after 2022.  
* **Predictive Biotech** ceased operations after the SEC settlement; its assets were sold to a private equity firm that re‑branded the remaining stem‑cell pipeline under a different name, none of which have reached clinical trials as of early 2026.  

### Public‑Policy Impact  

* The **2019 New Yorker/ProPublica exposé** (the source of many of the author’s points) spurred the **2020 FDA guidance** and the **2021 congressional hearing**.  
* Several states (California, Texas, New York) enacted **“Stem‑Cell Clinic Disclosure Laws”** between 2020‑2023, requiring clinics to post FDA status and to refrain from claiming cures for non‑approved conditions.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

The blog post itself did not contain explicit numerical forecasts, but it implied several expectations:

| Implied prediction (from the 2019 post) | What actually happened |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **“The industry is in urgent need of more FDA attention.”** | True. The FDA issued new guidance (2020) and multiple warning letters (2020‑2024), and a 2024 enforcement sweep shut down dozens of clinics. |
| **UCB would be “burdened and troubled” by claims made by its customers.** | Partially true. UCB received a warning letter (2020) and later withdrew an IND (2023) after regulators questioned its marketing claims. |
| **Short‑seller reports (e.g., Hindenburg) would expose fraud at companies like Predictive.** | Accurate. The SEC charged Predictive Biotech in 2022; the company collapsed. |
| **Patients would continue to see “miracle‑cure” testimonials on UCB’s website.** | The website still hosts patient testimonials (as of 2025), though the language has been toned down to avoid “cure” claims. |
| **Regulators would eventually require proof of efficacy for amniotic‑cell therapies.** | Largely correct. FDA now treats most amniotic‑tissue products as 351 biologics when marketed for therapeutic use, demanding INDs and clinical data. |

No bold, quantitative forecasts (e.g., “by 2022 the market will be worth $X”) were made, so the evaluation focuses on the qualitative expectations above.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The article is a useful primary‑source snapshot of the legal and reputational battles surrounding the perinatal‑tissue market just before a wave of regulatory tightening. It is especially valuable for historians of biotech policy and for anyone tracking how investigative journalism can catalyze FDA and congressional action. The piece is less interesting to a purely scientific audience because it contains no new data, but its real‑world impact on policy and on the fortunes of companies like Utah Cord Bank and Predictive Biotech makes it notably significant.
