# Avastin: False Hope for Metastatic Breast Cancer (Oct 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author argues that the FDA’s provisional (accelerated) approval of bevacizumab (Avastin) for metastatic breast cancer should be rescinded. The initial approval in 2008 was based on modest progression‑free survival (PFS) gains without overall‑survival (OS) benefit and with a notable increase in serious adverse events. By late 2011, additional trial data (e.g., the AVADO and RIBBON‑1 studies) and a FDA Oncology Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) vote highlighted that the drug did **not** extend life, offered only a 1–2‑month delay in tumor progression, and added toxicity. The author cites an ODAC member’s letter stating that offering patients a drug that “won’t make you live longer, won’t make you feel better, and may have life‑threatening side effects” is ethically untenable, and urges the FDA to withdraw the indication.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Regulatory outcome** – In December 2010 the FDA’s ODAC voted 12‑2 to recommend removal of the breast‑cancer indication. The agency formally **withdrawn** the accelerated approval on **21 Nov 2011**, a few weeks before the article’s publication. Since then, bevacizumab has remained approved for colorectal cancer, non‑small‑cell lung cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, and ovarian cancer, but **not** for breast cancer. Physicians may still prescribe it off‑label, but uptake has been minimal.

**Clinical evidence** – Subsequent analyses confirmed the limited benefit: pooled data from AVADO, RIBBON‑1, and the earlier E2100 trial showed a median PFS gain of ~2 months and **no OS improvement**. Meta‑analyses published in 2012–2014 reinforced that the risk‑benefit ratio was unfavorable for breast cancer patients, with higher rates of hypertension, bleeding, and gastrointestinal perforation.

**Industry impact** – Roche (Genentech) discontinued the commercial promotion of Avastin for breast cancer in the United States shortly after the withdrawal, though it continued marketing the drug for other indications. The episode prompted Roche to adjust its pipeline strategy, focusing on combinations that could demonstrate OS benefit.

**Policy and precedent** – The Avastin breast‑cancer controversy became a landmark case in the debate over the FDA’s **accelerated approval pathway**. It spurred the 2012 FDA guidance that required stronger post‑marketing confirmatory trials and led to the 2014 “Breakthrough Therapy” and “Priority Review” reforms that emphasize overall‑survival or validated surrogate endpoints. The case is frequently cited in policy discussions and in FDA advisory committee training.

**Biosimilars** – Beginning in 2017, several bevacizumab biosimilars (e.g., bevacizumab‑awwb, bevacizumab‑abdm) received FDA approval for the same indications as the reference product, but none have been pursued for breast cancer, reflecting the continued lack of a regulatory indication.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction:** *The FDA will withdraw the metastatic‑breast‑cancer indication.*  
  **Outcome:** Correct. The indication was withdrawn in November 2011.

- **Prediction:** *Avastin provides no overall‑survival benefit and only a short PFS gain, with added serious toxicity.*  
  **Outcome:** Confirmed by multiple phase‑III trials and meta‑analyses; OS benefit remained absent, PFS gain ≈1–2 months, and grade ≥ 3 adverse events were higher than control arms.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *The controversy will lead to tighter FDA scrutiny of accelerated approvals.*  
  **Outcome:** Largely true. The FDA introduced stricter post‑marketing requirements and revised its guidance on surrogate endpoints, citing the Avastin case as a catalyst.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *Avastin will continue to be a valuable drug for other cancers.*  
  **Outcome:** Accurate. Bevacizumab retains approvals and is widely used in colorectal, lung, renal, glioblastoma, and ovarian cancers, with ongoing combination studies.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The article is historically important because it captures a pivotal moment in oncology drug regulation and illustrates how post‑marketing data can overturn an accelerated approval, influencing both clinical practice and FDA policy.
