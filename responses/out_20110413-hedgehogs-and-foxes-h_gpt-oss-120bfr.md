# Hedgehogs and Foxes Holding Erlenmeyer Flasks (April 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post argues that chemistry has historically been a “fox” discipline—its leading figures tend to be generalists who hop between sub‑fields rather than “hedgehogs” who devote their whole careers to a single, narrowly defined problem. The author contrasts this with theoretical physics or mathematics, where celebrated hedgehogs (e.g., Andrew Wiles) spend decades on one deep question. He cites modern chemists such as George M. Whitesides, Christopher A. Schreiber, and Karl Barry Sharpless as exemplars of the fox archetype, and mentions H. C. Brown as a rare hedgehog in organic chemistry. The piece invites readers to suggest other names that fit either side of the dichotomy.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Career trajectories of the cited “foxes.”**  
- **George M. Whitesides** continued to expand his portfolio after 2011, publishing influential work on soft lithography, microfluidics, and, more recently, on the chemistry of sustainability (e.g., “green” solvents, renewable feedstocks). He also became a prominent advocate for “science communication” and “open‑source” laboratory hardware, reinforcing his reputation as a cross‑disciplinary catalyst.  
- **Christopher A. Schreiber** maintained his focus on chemical biology, notably advancing the “chemical probe” paradigm and founding the Broad Institute’s “Molecular Libraries Program” off‑shoots. His lab’s work on small‑molecule modulators of protein–protein interactions has moved several candidates into early‑phase clinical trials (e.g., BET‑inhibitor programs).  
- **Karl Barry Sharpless** earned a second Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2022 for click chemistry and bio‑orthogonal reactions, confirming the lasting impact of his “fox‑style” ability to create broadly applicable tools. Since 2011 he has also championed “click‑enabled” polymer and materials research, further diffusing his influence across sub‑disciplines.  

**The “hedgehog” exception – H. C. Brown.**  
Brown’s legacy as a specialist in organoborane chemistry remains strong; his reagents (e.g., Brown’s hydroboration) are still standard in undergraduate curricula and industrial synthesis. However, no new “hedgehog‑type” figure has emerged who dominates a single, narrowly defined chemical problem to the same extent.  

**Rise of new “foxes” and the blurring of the dichotomy.**  
- **John Buchwald** (metal‑catalyzed amination) has indeed become a quintessential fox: his palladium‑catalyzed C–N coupling methodology has been adopted industry‑wide, and his group has branched into photoredox‑mediated cross‑couplings, flow chemistry, and AI‑guided catalyst design.  
- **Jennifer Doudna & Emmanuelle Charpentier** (CRISPR‑Cas9) entered chemistry indirectly via genome‑editing tools that rely on nucleic‑acid chemistry. Their work illustrates a hybrid model: deep focus on a single molecular system (hedgehog) that nevertheless spawns countless interdisciplinary applications (fox).  
- **AI/ML integration** (e.g., the work of Regina Barzilay’s group at MIT, the “Molecule Transformer” from IBM, and the rise of platforms like Insilico Medicine) has created a new class of “computational foxes” who blend data science, synthetic chemistry, and drug discovery. By 2024, AI‑guided retrosynthesis tools (e.g., IBM RXN, Synthia) are routinely used in both academia and pharma, confirming the article’s claim that chemistry rewards breadth.  

**Institutional and policy shifts.**  
- Funding agencies (NIH, NSF, EU Horizon Europe) have increasingly emphasized “interdisciplinary” or “translational” chemistry, offering larger programmatic grants for collaborative, cross‑domain projects.  
- The rise of “chemistry‑centric” startup ecosystems (e.g., biotech firms built around novel catalytic platforms) reflects a market preference for versatile technologies rather than single‑target solutions.  

Overall, the post’s observation that chemistry thrives on fox‑like versatility has been reinforced by the subsequent decade’s developments: most high‑impact chemists continue to diversify, and the field’s infrastructure now explicitly rewards breadth.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself makes a few implicit forecasts; they are listed below with an assessment of how they panned out.

| Implicit prediction | What actually happened |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Chemistry will remain a “fox” field, with leading scientists spanning many sub‑disciplines.** | Confirmed. The careers of Whitesides, Sharpless, Buchwald, and newer figures (e.g., Doudna/Charpentier, AI‑driven chemists) illustrate continued breadth. |
| **Few “hedgehogs” will emerge; H. C. Brown is a rare example.** | Largely true. No chemist since Brown has achieved comparable singular focus and lasting impact on a single reaction class. Exceptions are niche (e.g., Robert Grubbs on olefin metathesis) but even they have broadened into materials and polymer science. |
| **The “fox” approach will be essential for tackling complex, detail‑rich problems.** | Supported by the success of multidisciplinary platforms such as click chemistry, CRISPR‑based gene editing, and AI‑assisted synthesis, all of which rely on integrating chemistry with biology, physics, or computer science. |
| **The “hedgehog vs. fox” metaphor will be useful for discussing scientific culture.** | The metaphor has been adopted in several later commentaries (e.g., Nature Chemistry “Hedgehogs, foxes and the future of catalysis” 2018) and is now a common shorthand in science‑policy debates. |

No explicit quantitative forecasts (e.g., market size) were made, so no further evaluation is needed.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  

The piece is a concise, thought‑provoking cultural commentary that correctly anticipated the continued importance of interdisciplinary, “fox‑style” research in chemistry. Its relevance has grown with the rise of AI‑driven synthesis and the proliferation of broadly applicable tools (click chemistry, CRISPR), making it more than a niche opinion column.
