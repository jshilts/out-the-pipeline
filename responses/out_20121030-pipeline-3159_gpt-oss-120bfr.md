# Back On the Air (Oct 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author describes a severe October 2012 storm that knocked down tree branches, caused power outages, and disrupted public‑transport service on the MBTA in the Boston area. The post notes that the weather was even worse farther south—in Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey—and that the system was also affecting the Great Lakes region (Cleveland, Detroit). The tone is personal and informal, simply reporting the author’s experience and wishing readers safety.

## 2. HISTORY  
- **The storm itself** – The event was the October 2012 nor’easter (sometimes called the “October 2012 North‑American storm complex”). It produced strong winds (up to ~70 mph) and widespread power outages across New England, the Mid‑Atlantic, and the Great Lakes.  
- **Immediate aftermath** – Utility companies (e.g., Eversource, National Grid) spent several days restoring service; the MBTA continued to experience delays and occasional cancellations for weeks while crews cleared debris and repaired damaged infrastructure.  
- **Subsequent major weather event** – Just a few days later, Hurricane Sandy made landfall (Nov 2 2012), causing far greater damage along the same corridor, especially in New York and New Jersey. The back‑to‑back storms highlighted vulnerabilities in the regional electric grid and public‑transport systems.  
- **Policy and infrastructure responses** – In the years following 2012, the affected states and municipalities invested in grid hardening (e.g., undergrounding power lines in parts of New York, increased tree‑trimming budgets) and in improving MBTA resilience (upgraded signaling, better snow‑removal equipment). Federal and state emergency‑management agencies also revised continuity‑of‑operations plans for mass‑transit systems after the dual‑storm experience.  
- **Long‑term impact** – No biotech‑related outcomes stemmed from this article; the primary legacy is a modest acceleration of infrastructure resilience measures in the Northeast, which have helped reduce outage durations in later storms (e.g., the 2018 “Winter Storm Riley” and the 2021 “Northeastern winter storm”).

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The post contains no explicit predictions about future events, technology, or industry trends. Consequently, there are no predictions to evaluate.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 2/10**  
The article is a brief, personal weather update with limited broader relevance; it offers little insight into lasting scientific, technological, or policy developments.
