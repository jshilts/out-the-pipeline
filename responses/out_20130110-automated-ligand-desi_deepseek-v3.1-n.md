# Automated Ligand Design? (January 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a Nature paper by Andrew Hopkins and Bryan Roth titled "Automated Design of Ligands to Polypharmacological Profiles." The research describes a machine-learning approach to modify known drug molecules to introduce new pharmacological activities while maintaining desirable properties. Using the Alzheimer's drug donepezil (Aricept) as a starting point, their system evolved the structure through successive rounds of transformation to achieve specific target profiles—such as adding D2 dopaminergic activity, then later removing unwanted alpha-adrenergic activity or creating selective D4 dopamine receptor compounds. The method achieved approximately 75% success rate on predictions within the well-characterized GPCR field, where extensive SAR data exists. The author speculates this approach should improve over time as knowledge accumulates, potentially handling much of the "grunt work" in drug discovery.

## 2. HISTORY

**Technology Adoption and Commercial Impact:**
The computational drug design approach described in this 2012 Nature paper became foundational to the company **Exscientia**, co-founded by Andrew Hopkins in 2012. Exscientia went public on NASDAQ in October 2021, reaching a valuation over $3 billion, though the stock has since declined significantly. The company has advanced multiple AI-designed drugs into clinical trials and established major partnerships with pharmaceutical companies including Bayer, Sanofi, and Bristol-Myers Squibb.

**Clinical Pipeline Development:**
Exscientia progressed several AI-designed molecules into human trials. Their first AI-designed immuno-oncology drug (EXS-21546) and first AI-designed psychiatric drug (DSP-0038) entered Phase 1 trials in 2021–2022. In 2023–2024, they advanced additional oncology candidates, though EXS-21546 was deprioritized in 2024 after failing to show sufficient preliminary efficacy. The approach has successfully demonstrated the ability to progress molecules from design to clinical testing, validating the general methodology's feasibility.

**Scientific and Industry Evolution:**
The polypharmacology targeting strategy described has become increasingly important, particularly in CNS drug discovery where multi-target profiles are often desirable. However, the 75% success rate in well-characterized target classes like GPCRs reflects the continued challenge that computational methods work best where extensive training data exists. The broader field has expanded beyond GPCRs to include kinases and other target classes, but data limitations remain a significant constraint.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Knowledge piles up...This approach...should be getting more powerful and useful as time goes on."** ✓ **Accurate.** The field has grown substantially since 2013. Hundreds of papers now build on these approaches, and computational drug discovery has become standard practice in pharmaceutical companies.

• **"I have no trouble picturing an eventual future where such algorithms do a lot of the grunt work of drug discovery"** ✓ **Accurate, with caveats.** AI systems now routinely perform lead optimization and virtual screening in pharmaceutical companies, but human medicinal chemists remain essential for final decisions, synthetic feasibility assessment, and strategic thinking.

• **"Unless, of course, you do GPCR ligand drug discovery. In that case, I'd be contacting the authors of this paper as soon as possible"** ✓ **Prescient.** Hopkins founded Exscientia based on this work and created a successful business in precisely this space.

• **"I don't foresee that [replacing human work] happening for a while yet"** ✓ **Accurate.** While AI handles significant workload in drug discovery, complete automation remains elusive—human expertise remains critical for interpreting results and strategic decisions.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

The article identified a genuinely transformative technology at an early stage and correctly foresaw its commercialization trajectory and the data-dependency limitations that would shape its development.
