# Gaining and Losing and Discovering and Selling (January 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2010 commentary addresses the challenges pharmaceutical companies face in developing effective obesity drugs. The author discusses a JAMA paper debunking the simplified "3,500 kcal = 1 pound" rule, showing instead that a daily 60-calorie excess leads asymptotically to about 6 pounds of weight gain, not the hundreds of pounds predicted by linear models.

The article critically examines obesity drug development in light of physiological realities: maintenance costs of body weight create equilibrium effects, most overweight individuals have far greater caloric imbalances than a "cookie a day," and sustainable weight loss requires timeframes proportional to weight gain duration. The author expresses skepticism about both individual lifestyle interventions and regulatory approaches, while noting the commercial attractiveness of obesity drugs creates a "moral hazard" - drugs may sell well regardless of real-world effectiveness, with patient non-compliance providing convenient explanations for poor performance.

## 2. HISTORY

**Obesity Drug Approvals and Failures (2010-2024):**

- **2012**: FDA approved Belviq (lorcaserin), later withdrawn in 2020 due to cancer concerns
- **2014**: Contrave (naltrexone/bupropion) approved, with modest efficacy (~5% weight loss)
- **2014**: Saxenda (liraglutide 3mg) approved - GLP-1 agonist showing better efficacy
- **2021**: Wegovy (semaglutide 2.4mg) approved - breakthrough GLP-1 showing 15-17% weight loss
- **2023**: Zepbound (tirzepatide) approved - dual GIP/GLP-1 agonist showing 20-25% weight loss

**Market Realities:**
- GLP-1 drugs became massive commercial successes, with Wegovy generating billions in revenue, validating the author's prediction about strong sales despite modest individual results
- Unlike predictions in the article, these drugs demonstrate efficacy beyond behavioral interventions alone, with sustained weight loss maintained in long-term studies
- High pricing (~$1,000-1,500/month) and insurance coverage challenges limited widespread access, creating equity concerns

**Regulatory and Policy Changes:**
- No significant regulatory interventions on food supply occurred as suggested in JAMA paper
- Obesity recognized as disease by AMA in 2013, changing insurance and treatment approaches
- Emphasis shifted toward pharmacological management rather than solely behavioral interventions

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Any sustainable weight loss probably should take about as much time as the initial weight gain did"** - **Mostly accurate**: GLP-1 drugs show sustained effects over years, but achieve significant loss faster than gradual weight gain, though maintenance requires continued treatment

• **Obesity drugs "would sell like crazy" regardless of real-world effectiveness** - **Accurate**: Wegovy and similar drugs achieved multi-billion dollar sales despite ~15-20% weight loss (not eliminating obesity), demonstrating strong market demand

• **"Any such treatment still has to be coupled with all those things that patients don't want to hear about: less food, more exercise"** - **Partially inaccurate**: Modern obesity drugs work significantly without major lifestyle changes, though combination with lifestyle modification enhances results

• **Doubt about whether "a really good weight-loss drug is even possible"** - **Inaccurate in hindsight**: GLP-1 and dual agonists achieve 15-25% weight loss, far exceeding previous drugs and representing meaningful clinical benefit

• **Skepticism about regulatory interventions on food supply** - **Accurate**: No major regulatory changes occurred to address obesity through food policy, though some voluntary industry initiatives emerged

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates prescient understanding of obesity drug commercial dynamics while underestimating the potential for GLP-1 breakthroughs. Its insights into the intersection of physiology, commercial incentives, and regulatory challenges remain relevant as expensive obesity drugs reshape treatment paradigms and healthcare economics.
