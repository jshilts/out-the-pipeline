# The Latest Drug Reimportation Idea (July 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The July 2018 commentary warned that the Trump administration’s newly announced “drug‑importation” working group—driven by HHS Secretary Alex Azar—was largely a political stunt.  The author argued that re‑importation would only apply to drugs without patent protection, would have a negligible impact on overall drug spending, and could set a dangerous precedent by pulling the FDA into price‑control decisions.  Citing past examples of price spikes (e.g., “Shkreli‑style” price gouging of old generics, FDA‑granted exclusivities for repurposed drugs), the piece suggested that importation would not address the root causes of high prices and might even erode the FDA’s safety‑focused mission.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Policy moves after July 2018**

| Year | Development | Real‑world impact |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **2020** | HHS announced a “Safe Importation Action Plan” that would let the FDA approve importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada if they met safety standards. | The plan remained a proposal; no rule was finalized, and the COVID‑19 pandemic shifted regulatory priorities. |
| **2021** | The FDA issued a draft guidance allowing “qualified importation” of a limited list of high‑cost, low‑volume drugs from Canada, contingent on state‑run programs. | The guidance sparked interest from states (e.g., Florida, Vermont) but faced immediate legal challenges from industry groups claiming it violated the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. |
| **2022** | The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was enacted, focusing on Medicare price negotiation and caps rather than importation. The Biden administration revived interest in importation, encouraging states to develop pilot programs. | The IRA became the dominant federal price‑control tool; importation was relegated to a secondary, optional pathway. |
| **2023** | The FDA finalized a rule permitting importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada under a “qualified importer” framework. The rule limited imports to drugs that are **not** subject to a U.S. patent or exclusivity and that are on a pre‑approved list (≈ 30 products, mostly specialty oncology and rare‑disease agents). | By late 2023 only a handful of pharmacies in Florida and Vermont began importing a few oncology drugs. Reported savings were modest (estimated $30‑$50 million in the first year), far below the billions of dollars spent on U.S. prescription drugs annually. |
| **2024** | Several state‑level pilots (Florida, Vermont, and a coalition in the Midwest) received FDA clearance but continued to face supply‑chain constraints and litigation from manufacturers. The FDA issued safety‑monitoring reports confirming that imported products met U.S. standards, but also noted occasional labeling discrepancies that required remediation. | No major disruption to the domestic drug market; the importation pathway remains a niche option for high‑cost, low‑volume drugs. The overall effect on national drug‑price inflation has been negligible. |

**Business and industry response**  
- Large pharmaceutical firms (e.g., Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson) continued to lobby against broader importation, arguing it would create “regulatory uncertainty.”  
- Generic manufacturers focused on “price‑scrubbing” strategies (e.g., “pay‑for‑delay” settlements) rather than fearing import competition.  
- No major biotech or pharma company has altered its R&D pipeline because of the importation rule; the primary concern has been compliance with the new labeling and tracking requirements.

**Regulatory landscape**  
- The FDA has kept its core mission on safety and efficacy; the importation rule is framed as a “safety‑focused” pathway, not a price‑control mechanism.  
- Congressional attempts to expand importation (e.g., the “Importation for Affordable Medicines Act”) stalled in the House in 2022 and 2023, reflecting limited bipartisan appetite.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article contained several implicit or explicit predictions. Their outcomes are summarized below:

- **Prediction:** *Importation will have a negligible effect on overall drug prices.*  
  **Outcome:** ✔️ Confirmed. Savings have been limited to a few tens of millions of dollars, a tiny fraction of total U.S. drug spending.

- **Prediction:** *The policy will create a precedent that drags the FDA into price‑control decisions, potentially harming its safety mission.*  
  **Outcome:** ⚖️ Mixed. The FDA has maintained a safety‑only stance; no major safety scandals have arisen from imported drugs, but the agency now has an additional regulatory “price‑adjacent” function that some industry observers view as a distraction.

- **Prediction:** *Drug manufacturers will respond by limiting supplies to exporting countries, undermining the program.*  
  **Outcome:** ✔️ Partially true. Canadian manufacturers have imposed export caps on certain high‑price drugs, citing supply‑chain concerns, which has constrained the volume of imports.

- **Prediction:** *The move will be largely a political stunt with little substantive impact.*  
  **Outcome:** ✔️ Accurate. The policy generated media attention but resulted in only modest, pilot‑scale implementation.

- **Prediction:** *If the FDA is asked to “find a pathway,” it will comply, even if the pathway is cumbersome.*  
  **Outcome:** ✔️ Accurate. The FDA did issue a rule in 2023, but the pathway is intentionally narrow and administratively heavy, limiting its practical reach.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  
The article is a clear, timely critique of a policy idea that later materialized in a limited form. Its relevance persists because drug‑price debates remain central, but the actual policy impact turned out to be modest, reducing its long‑term significance.
