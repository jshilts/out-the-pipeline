# End of a Year (December 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

This blog-style article is a personal reflection from a drug discovery researcher as they close out the year 2016. The author discusses their approach to tackling hard problems and argues for pursuing "long-shot" projects over "sure thing" initiatives. Their reasoning is pragmatic: in drug discovery nothing is truly a sure thing, and while long shots face similar odds, they offer greater reward and recognition when successful. The piece emphasizes the balance between focusing on details while maintaining a broad perspective, and expresses appreciation for the unexpected moments in science where anomalous results might lead to breakthroughs.

## 2. HISTORY

This article was published in December 2016 on Derek Lowe's widely-read drug discovery blog "In the Pipeline," hosted by Science magazine. The blog, which has run since 2002, serves as an informal insider commentary on pharmaceutical R&D. The author wrote this piece as part of regular year-end reflections. Over subsequent years, the author continued to write about these same themes, exploring how pharmaceutical risk manifests in major trials like those for Alzheimer's therapies (e.g., the amyloid hypothesis), oncology targets, and novel modalities like mRNA and gene therapies. The perspective articulated here—that drug discovery is inherently high-risk and unpredictable—has been validated repeatedly. Between 2016 and 2024, the industry experienced high-profile failures in many programs that were once considered sure bets, while some previously uncertain platforms and targets (CRISPR, mRNA vaccines, certain checkpoint inhibitors) delivered transformative outcomes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Prediction**: The author expected to continue seeing "oddities, surprises, reversals (in both directions) and sudden insights" in drug research.
  - **Outcome**: This proved highly accurate. The 2017–2024 period included numerous field-wide reversals, such as the mixed clinical results for amyloid-targeting Alzheimer's therapies after many had been "sure things," high-profile Phase III failures in oncology and neurology for well-funded programs, and validation of previously uncertain technologies (e.g., mRNA vaccines' 2020 success). Uncertainty, surprises, and unpredicted breakthroughs remained hallmarks of the biotech landscape.

- **Prediction**: The author endorsed the principle of working on "the hardest, most important problems available" and predicted that such a focus would lead to interesting outcomes.
  - **Outcome**: This aligns with how the field evolved through 2024. Efforts on intractable diseases often produced limited success, while select major challenges (e.g., sickle cell disease via CRISPR; COVID vaccines via mRNA) generated breakthrough results—underscoring that difficulty alone does not determine outcome and that transformative hits often arise unpredictably.

- **Prediction**: The author suggested "everything's a long shot" in drug discovery and that "can't-miss" projects are not actually safer.
  - **Outcome**: This was validated repeatedly in subsequent years. A high proportion of programs widely viewed as high-confidence around 2016 (e.g., many immuno-oncology combinations, pancreatic cancer trials, and neurodegenerative disease trials) ultimately failed, while some unconventional approaches later became standard of care—confirming that near-term hype and long-term success often diverge.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

A thoughtful but niche personal reflection whose insights are familiar to industry insiders. It offers little in the way of specific events or forward-looking substance to ground historical analysis.
