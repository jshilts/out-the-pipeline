# Holiday Break (23 Dec 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY

The author announces a holiday blogging break from December 23, 2020 through January 2nd, with plans for intermittent posts including possible cooking recipes. The author explicitly mentions taking a break from coronavirus-related content and expresses hope that 2021 will be "more sane" compared to 2020, which is described with difficulty finding appropriate adjectives due to the overwhelming nature of the year's events.

## 2. HISTORY

This post was published during the COVID-19 pandemic's first full year. While it doesn't discuss biotechnology or science topics directly, its timing is significant - it appeared as vaccines were beginning to be authorized (Pfizer-BioNTech received FDA EUA on December 11, 2020, and Moderna on December 18, 2020). The author's hope for 2021 being "more sane" proved premature, as 2021 continued to be dominated by pandemic concerns including vaccine rollouts, new variants (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta variants emerged during 2021), and ongoing public health measures. The blog's stated focus on cooking rather than coronavirus information reflected a widespread desire for normalcy that would not be fully realized in 2021.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The author made one explicit prediction: "2021 is going to have to be more sane, right? Reversion to the mean and so on?"

• **Prediction: 2021 would be more sane than 2020** - This prediction did not fully materialize. While vaccine availability improved throughout 2021, the year continued to be dominated by pandemic developments including new SARS-CoV-2 variants, vaccine hesitancy debates, breakthrough infections, and evolving public health guidance. Rather than "reversion to the mean," 2021 represented the second consecutive year of pandemic dominance in public discourse and daily life.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **0/10**

This is a personal blog announcement post about taking a holiday break and contains no substantive information about biotechnology, science, or industry developments relevant to the analytical task.
