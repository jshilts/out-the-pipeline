# The Prospects of an Academic Job (July 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the grim employment prospects for PhDs in biomedical sciences pursuing academic careers. It references a Nature Jobs piece by Jessica Polka, a Harvard Medical School post-doc, who highlighted that too many graduate students lack an accurate understanding of the academic job market.

The key data point presented is stark: approximately 16,000 students begin graduate school in biology in the US each year, yet fewer than 10% will eventually secure tenure-track faculty positions. This creates a massive mismatch between expectations and reality, as at least half of these students list tenure-track academia as their most preferred career path. The author emphasizes that early awareness of these statistics is crucial for graduate students to make informed career decisions.

## 2. HISTORY

In the decade following this 2014 article, the academic job market in biomedical sciences has remained consistently challenging, with some indicators suggesting further deterioration:

**Academic Position Availability**: The percentage of biology/biomedical PhDs securing tenure-track positions has remained low, generally staying in the single digits or low double-digits. Some analyses from 2018-2022 placed the figure around 12-15% at best, though this varied significantly by institution prestige and field specialization.

**Alternative Career Paths Growth**: There has been significant growth in alternative career paths for PhD scientists, including:
- Industry positions in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals (which expanded notably from 2014-2021)
- Science policy and communication roles
- Technology transfer and intellectual property positions
- Data science and computational biology roles outside academia
- Science education and outreach positions

**Impact of COVID-19**: The pandemic (2020-2022) created additional pressures on academia, with hiring freezes at many institutions, lab shutdowns affecting research productivity, and increased competition for limited positions.

**Structural Changes**: Many universities have increased reliance on non-tenure-track positions (adjuncts, instructors, research faculty), creating a more precarious academic workforce. The postdoc-to-faculty pipeline has not fundamentally improved in efficiency.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction: "fewer than 10% will eventually become tenure-track faculty"**
- **Accuracy**: This has proven largely accurate. Data from 2017-2023 consistently shows that 10-15% of biomedical PhDs secure tenure-track positions within 5-7 years post-PhD, with significant variation by institution and field.

**Implicit Prediction: Mismatch between student expectations and market realities will continue**
- **Accuracy**: Highly accurate. Surveys from NIH and academic organizations through 2023 continued showing that 40-50% of entering graduate students aspire to tenure-track positions, despite the persistent 10-15% success rate.

**Implicit Prediction: Early awareness is beneficial**
- **Accuracy**: Mixed. While awareness programs have expanded, the fundamental structural issues (more PhDs produced than academic positions available) have not been resolved, suggesting the problem requires systemic rather than informational solutions.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article highlighted an important structural problem in biomedical career training that remains highly relevant today. However, the issue was already well-documented by 2014, so this piece served more as reinforcement of known challenges rather than revealing new insights.
