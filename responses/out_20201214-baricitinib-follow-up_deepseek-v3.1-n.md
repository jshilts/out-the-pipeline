# Baricitinib Follow-Up: An AI Prediction for Coronavirus Therapy (December 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article reviews the trajectory of baricitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor initially used for rheumatoid arthritis, as a potential COVID-19 therapy. The drug was identified by BenevolentAI through machine‑learning analysis of medical literature in February 2020, highlighting its ability to inhibit adapter‑associated kinase 1 (AAK1) and disrupt viral entry via endocytosis—an idea with roots in antiviral research dating back to 2007.

By December 2020, clinical data showed that the combination of baricitinib and remdesivir reduced recovery time by one day compared to remdesivir alone, with trends toward reduced mortality and less need for oxygen/ventilation, particularly in critically ill patients. The FDA had issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for this combination. The article notes uncertainty about whether baricitinib's benefits come from the originally proposed AAK1 mechanism or its known anti‑inflammatory effects, especially since another JAK inhibitor (ruxolitinib) failed in COVID-19 trials. A head‑to‑head trial against dexamethasone was planned but not yet completed.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the December 2020 article, baricitinib's role in COVID-19 treatment continued to evolve through further clinical trials and regulatory decisions:

- **FDA Approval Expansion (May 2021)**: The FDA expanded the emergency use authorization for baricitinib (in combination with remdesivir) for hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen, based on additional data from the ACTT-2 trial.
- **WHO Guidelines (July 2021)**: The World Health Organization conditionally recommended baricitinib for severe or critical COVID-19 patients, citing evidence of reduced mortality and need for ventilation.
- **Standalone Efficacy (2021-2022)**: The COV-BARRIER trial demonstrated that baricitinib alone (without remdesivir) reduced mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, particularly those on high-flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation.
- **FDA Full Approval (May 2022)**: The FDA granted full approval for baricitinib (under brand name Olumiant) for hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen, making it the first immunomodulator specifically approved for COVID-19 treatment.
- **Real-World Uptake**: Baricitinib became widely adopted in hospital protocols globally, particularly for moderate to severe COVID-19 cases, often alongside corticosteroids like dexamethasone.
- **Mechanism Confusion Persists**: Despite clinical success, it remains unclear whether benefits derive from anti-inflammatory JAK inhibition or the originally proposed AAK1/endocytosis mechanism. The drug's relative expense compared to dexamethasone limited universal adoption in resource-constrained settings.
- **Omicron and Beyond**: Baricitinib maintained efficacy across variants including Delta and Omicron, with treatment guidelines continuing to recommend it for severe cases even as outpatient therapies evolved for milder disease.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several predictions and observations about future developments:

- **Dexamethasone Comparison Trial**: A head-to-head trial between remdesivir/baricitinib and remdesivir/dexamethasone was mentioned as "going to happen."
  - *Outcome*: This specific trial appears not to have been completed or reported significant results. Instead, both drugs became established in treatment guidelines, often used in combination rather than as alternatives.
  
- **Mechanism Resolution**: The article questioned whether baricitinib's benefits came from AAK1 inhibition (original AI hypothesis) or general JAK/cytokine inhibition.
  - *Outcome*: The mechanism remains unresolved. Most subsequent literature emphasizes the anti-inflammatory JAK inhibition effects rather than AAK1-mediated viral entry inhibition.
  
- **Comparative Effectiveness**: The article suggested we'd learn "how useful it is under real world patient care conditions" compared to inexpensive dexamethasone.
  - *Outcome*: Both drugs became standard of care in severe COVID-19. Meta-analyses showed baricitinib provides incremental mortality benefit even when added to corticosteroids, establishing dual immunomodulation as beneficial.

- **AI Prediction Capabilities**: The author noted it would be "a long time before" AI could predict real-world clinical outcomes.
  - *Outcome*: Accurate assessment. While AI helped identify candidates like baricitinib, clinical validation remained essential and mechanisms proved more complex than initial AI-driven hypotheses.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article captures a significant moment where AI-driven drug repurposing met clinical validation during a global health crisis, combining cutting-edge technology with real-world medical need.
