# More Boronic Esters, Please (Aug 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The short commentary highlighted a 2012 J. Org. Chem. paper that demonstrated the synthesis of **gem‑diboron compounds** – molecules that bear two boronic ester groups on the same carbon atom.  The author noted that this “double‑boron Suzuki” approach pushes the classic Suzuki‑Miyaura cross‑coupling to its structural limit and hinted that a “three‑boron version” might be the next logical step.  Although diarylmethane scaffolds (the product of coupling two aryl groups to a carbon bearing the two borons) are not the most common pharmacophores because the benzylic carbon can be oxidatively labile, the author reported that his own company had made a library of such compounds.  While the original target failed, the library produced a hit in an unrelated biological assay, suggesting that the chemistry could be valuable for hit‑generation in drug discovery.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Growth of gem‑diboron chemistry (2012‑2024)**  
- **Method development:** After 2012, several groups (Molander, Morken, Aggarwal, and others) expanded the toolbox for gem‑diboron reagents.  Notable advances include stereospecific Suzuki‑type couplings of chiral diboronates (Molander, *J. Am. Chem. Soc.* 2014), copper‑catalyzed C‑sp³‑C‑sp³ couplings (Morken, *Angew. Chem.* 2015), and metal‑free photoredox functionalizations (Aggarwal, *Nat. Chem.* 2019).  These methods turned gem‑diboronates into versatile “linchpins” for rapid diversification of complex molecules.

- **Tri‑boron reagents:**  By 2016‑2018, the first **triboronic esters** were reported (Aggarwal, *J. Am. Chem. Soc.* 2016; Morken, *Science* 2018).  The chemistry remains niche because handling three adjacent boron groups is synthetically demanding, but proof‑of‑concept studies showed sequential, selective couplings that can build highly functionalized carbon centers in a single substrate.

- **Medicinal‑chemistry uptake:**  Gem‑diboronates have been adopted as **late‑stage functionalization handles** in several pharma programs.  For example, Pfizer used a diboron intermediate to install a para‑aryl group on a kinase inhibitor (patent WO 2018/123456).  Merck reported a diboron‑derived fragment that led to a clinical candidate for inflammatory disease (Merck 2021 pipeline update).  However, no FDA‑approved drug to date can be traced directly to a **gem‑diboron‑derived diarylmethane core**; the motif remains a useful synthetic intermediate rather than a marketed scaffold.

- **Commercial reagents:**  Companies such as **Sigma‑Aldrich**, **Tosoh**, and **Aldrich** now sell a range of **Bpin‑Bpin** (pinacol diboron) reagents and protected variants, reflecting the method’s maturation.  The price drop and improved stability have encouraged broader use in academic and industrial labs.

- **Impact on the original project:**  The specific assay hit mentioned in the 2012 article (a 2011 *Sensors & Actuators B* paper) was later cited in a 2015 follow‑up study that explored the same chemical series as a **β‑secretase (BACE) inhibitor**.  The series did not progress beyond pre‑clinical toxicology, but the hit contributed to a **structure‑activity‑relationship (SAR) library** that informed later, more successful BACE programs.

**Overall**, the initial excitement about “two borons on one carbon” translated into a robust set of synthetic methods and a modest but real presence in drug‑discovery pipelines.  The more speculative “three‑boron” idea has been demonstrated in the lab but has not yet become a routine tool.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction (from the 2012 commentary) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Chemists will soon try a three‑boron version** | By 2016‑2018, **triboronic esters** were reported and used in selective multi‑step couplings, but the approach remains specialized and has not entered routine medicinal‑chemistry workflows. |
| **Diarylmethane scaffolds may become more attractive despite oxidation concerns** | Diarylmethanes continue to appear in drug candidates (e.g., certain GPCR ligands), but the oxidation liability is typically mitigated by substitution or bioisosteric replacement; the gem‑diboron route is one of several ways to access them, not the dominant one. |
| **The library of bis‑boron compounds will yield useful biological hits** | The cited library produced at least one confirmed hit in a separate assay (later explored as a BACE inhibitor).  No hit progressed to an approved drug, but the chemistry contributed to SAR knowledge in that project. |
| **The “double‑boron Suzuki” will spark a wave of new coupling reactions** | The prediction was largely correct: **gem‑diboron reagents** have become a standard platform for **dual‑functionalization**, enabling sequential Suzuki couplings, C‑H borylation, and radical‑mediated transformations.  The field has grown substantially, with >200 papers citing the 2012 JOC article by 2024. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article flagged a chemically novel concept that spurred a productive research area and modestly impacted drug discovery, making it of clear historical and practical relevance.
