# A Look Back at "A Look Back at Big Pharma Stocks" (2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

Derek Lowe's 2014 blog post revisited his earlier analysis of pharmaceutical company stock performance, examining big pharma returns across multiple time frames: ~4 years (2010-2014), 10 years (2004-2014), ~14 years (2000-2014), and ~24 years (1990-2014). The core finding was that most major drug companies significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with notable exceptions like Bristol-Myers Squibb (excelling from 2010-2014 due to oncology pipeline excitement), Pfizer (strong in some periods), and especially Johnson & Johnson, which consistently delivered respectable returns across longer time horizons.

The article made a crucial argument about diversification: against conventional Wall Street wisdom that pharmaceutical companies should "undiversify" to unlock shareholder value, Lowe suggested that diversification might actually be beneficial because drug R&D risk cannot be effectively mitigated through portfolio management alone. He pointed to J&J's diversified medical businesses and Bayer as evidence that conglomerate models might offer stability. The piece concluded with skepticism about Pfizer's contemporary strategy of shedding non-pharma assets, positioning them as running a real-world experiment in undiversification.

## 2. HISTORY

The subsequent decade (2014-2024) proved transformational for the pharmaceutical industry, unfolding in ways that partially validated and partially contradicted Lowe's analysis.

**Stock Performance Reality**: The 2014-2024 period witnessed dramatic divergence in pharmaceutical fortunes. Many companies continued struggling with the "patent cliff" problem Lowe identified, but new factors emerged. The 2015-2020 period saw continued pressure on traditional blockbuster drug models, while 2020-2022 brought unprecedented focus on pharmaceutical companies due to COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic development. mRNA vaccine success propelled companies like Pfizer and BioNTech to unprecedented profitability, while others benefited from COVID treatments.

**The Diversification Paradox Deepened**: Pfizer in fact proceeded with its "undiversification" strategy, spinning off or selling various non-pharma businesses. However, the results were mixed. While Pfizer saw substantial COVID-related gains, much of this stemmed from specific scientific breakthroughs (mRNA vaccines) rather than corporate structure changes. Johnson & Johnson largely maintained its diversified model and continued relatively stable performance, suggesting Lowe's thesis about diversification benefits had merit.

**Industry Restructuring Accelerated**: The post-2014 period saw continued massive M&A activity (Bristol-Myers Squibb acquired Celgene for $74 billion in 2019; AbbVie acquired Allergan for $63 billion in 2019; AstraZeneca made multiple major acquisitions). Patent cliffs remained problematic, but companies increasingly turned to acquiring innovation rather than developing it internally – a trend Lowe had noted but which intensified dramatically.

**Research Productivity Challenges Persisted**: The fundamental R&D productivity problem Lowe identified – where portfolio management "failed miserably" – continued largely unabated. Drug development costs kept rising while success rates remained low. The industry increasingly relied on smaller biotech companies for innovation, with big pharma serving as late-stage acquirers and commercializers.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Lowe's Correct Predictions**:
1. **Pfizer's Undiversification Experiment Would Be Revealing**: Ten years later, we can see that Pfizer's strategy of focusing purely on pharma had mixed results. While they achieved massive COVID-related success, this was largely attributable to specific scientific opportunities rather than corporate structure. The "experiment" indeed provided valuable data, though interpretation remains complex.

2. **J&J's Diversified Model Would Remain Stable**: Johnson & Johnson's performance over 2014-2024 largely validated Lowe's assessment. They maintained relatively steady performance, though no spectacular growth. Their diversified businesses helped smooth earnings volatility.

3. **Risk Mitigation in Drug R&D Would Remain Difficult**: The fundamental challenge of unpredictable R&D outcomes persisted and arguably intensified. Portfolio management approaches continued showing limitations, with major companies still facing patent cliff crises.

**Lowe's Questionable or Wrong Predictions**:
1. **The Implicit Skepticism About Current Market Valuations**: The article hinted that 2014 valuations might be stretched for many pharma companies. However, the subsequent decade (especially 2020-2022) proved that pharmaceutical companies could deliver spectacular returns when scientific breakthroughs aligned with market opportunities.

2. **Bristol-Myers Squibb's Strong Performance**: While BMS had been a star performer 2010-2014, their subsequent decade was more mixed, particularly due to challenges in the competitive immuno-oncology space where their lead narrowed considerably.

3. **Capital Allocation Challenges**: Lowe suggested capital was avoiding pharma due to poor risk-adjusted returns. However, the 2014-2024 period saw substantial capital flowing into biotech and pharma, particularly during the 2019-2021 boom. While volatility remained high, investor appetite for pharmaceutical innovation actually increased.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 7/10**

This article ranks in the 70-79th percentile of interest and importance. While it might seem narrowly focused on stock market performance at first glance, Lowe successfully used financial metrics to illuminate deeper structural challenges in pharmaceutical R&D and business models. His contrarian defense of diversification against prevailing Wall Street wisdom was empirically grounded and prescient.

The article's value lies in identifying fundamental, persistent industry challenges – particularly around R&D risk management and the limitations of portfolio management – that remained highly relevant through 2024. Lowe's recognition that drug development risk is inherently difficult to diversify away proved accurate, as companies continued struggling with patent cliffs and pipeline gaps.

What keeps this from a higher score (8-9) is its relatively narrow analytical framework (primarily stock market returns) and the somewhat limited scope of its predictive claims. However, it demonstrated sound understanding of pharmaceutical industry economics and provided a useful strategic framework for thinking about diversification versus focus. The article aged reasonably well, with its core insights remaining relevant for understanding subsequent industry developments.

The most interesting aspect is how the article balances financial analysis with deep industry knowledge, using market performance as a diagnostic tool for underlying business model health – an approach that proved more insightful than simple financial commentary.
