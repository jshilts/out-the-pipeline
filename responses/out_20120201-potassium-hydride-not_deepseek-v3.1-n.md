# Potassium Hydride Is Not Your Friend (February 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY

This is a commentary on laboratory safety concerning potassium hydride (KH), sparked by a near-miss fire incident involving chemist blogger Milkshake. The article compares the hazards of sodium hydride (typically supplied as 60% mineral oil dispersion) versus those of potassium hydride; the author advises readers to avoid even the "95% dry" sodium hydride due to risk of spontaneous ignition and to proceed with caution when weighing it. 

The discussion notes that potassium hydride is even less forgiving: it is traditionally sold as 35% dispersion under mineral oil, tends to settle and clog pipettes, and requires careful handling. The author mentions that a wax-dispersion form of KH was emerging at the time to improve handling, but worries that easier use could lead to more fires during workups—the point where Milkshake's reaction ran into trouble. The tone is cautionary and grounded in practical bench experience.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent developments confirm that KH has remained a high-hazard reagent handled primarily by specialists. Although the wax-dispersion format gained some adoption, incidents persisted. An N₂-dried storage and handling protocol outlined in *Organic Process Research & Development* aimed to reduce ignition risks, and vendors added stronger warnings. Leading fine-chemical suppliers continue to offer KH predominantly as mineral oil dispersions (typically 30-35%), occasionally as paraffin wax dispersions. 

There have been no major shifts in regulatory requirements tied specifically to KH, but general lab safety codes emphasize risk assessment, local exhaust, and non-aqueous quenching for pyrophoric reagents. While KH is still used in niche applications (e.g., certain deprotonations and hydrogenations), many synthetic routes are redesigned to avoid it where possible. Post-publication incidents include bench-scale fires due to improper handling, including the 2018 death of a UCLA researcher using t-BuLi in a procedure that illustrates broader pyrophoric-reagent risks, reinforcing institutional controls on training and storage for air-sensitive materials. 

Overall, KH did not see broad adoption beyond specialized industrial or academic settings, and efforts to improve its handling have focused on dispersion formulations and process controls rather than on fundamentally changing its hazard profile.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Oil vs. wax dispersion safety**: The article voiced concern that easier-to-handle wax dispersions might increase fire incidents during workups.  
  - *Outcome*: Limited adoption of wax dispersions occurred, but incidents persisted regardless of formulation; broader safety improvements hinged on exposure controls, quenching protocols, and training rather than the carrier medium.
- **Sodium hydride "95% dry" material risk**: The author warned that dry, high-purity NaH invites spontaneous ignition and that storage integrity is unreliable.  
  - *Outcome*: Dry NaH remains available but is widely recognized as high risk; its use is confined to controlled environments with appropriate inert-atmosphere techniques and quenching protocols.
- **Continued relevance of KH in synthesis**: The commentary implies KH would remain in use despite its dangers.  
  - *Outcome*: KH is still used in niche contexts but is often avoided in favor of safer bases when feasible; no widespread uptake in routine synthesis occurred.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

Reasoning: This article is a narrowly focused lab-safety commentary with modest broader impact. It serves as a useful cautionary note for synthetic chemists, but its scope is too limited to rank highly on general interest and long-term importance.
