# Difficult to Measure (November 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses how Bill James' approach to baseball analytics—questioning received wisdom and using data-driven analysis—applies to drug discovery. James reflected that skepticism should be directed at things that are actually untrue rather than things that are simply difficult to measure. The author connects this insight to the pharmaceutical industry, where many important concepts and processes are inherently difficult to quantify. The article identifies two opposing errors in drug discovery: either dismissing everything as unmeasurable "crap," or embracing any quantitative approach without proper validation. The piece emphasizes that navigating between these extremes remains a significant challenge in the field.

## 2. HISTORY

Subsequent to this 2014 article, the tension between difficult-to-measure biological processes and the push for quantification in drug discovery has continued to unfold with notable developments:

**Continued challenges in drug development**: Despite advances in analytical technologies, drug development success rates have remained stubbornly low. From 2014-2024, clinical trial success rates across all therapeutic areas have stayed roughly consistent, with Phase II remaining the biggest bottleneck due to challenges in demonstrating efficacy—the very "difficult to measure" problem the article identifies.

**AI and machine learning adoption**: The pharmaceutical industry has invested heavily in computational approaches, with AI/machine learning applications growing significantly since 2014. However, concrete clinical successes from AI-driven drug discovery have been modest. While companies can identify potential drug candidates faster, translation to approved therapies has remained challenging, illustrating the article's warning about embracing quantification without sufficient validation.

**Biomarker development**: There has been substantial progress in developing measurable biomarkers for drug response and disease progression, addressing the measurement challenge directly. Biomarker-driven clinical trials now represent a growing proportion of studies, particularly in oncology.

**Regulatory evolution**: The FDA and EMA have introduced more flexible regulatory pathways (adaptive trials, real-world evidence frameworks) that acknowledge the difficulty of traditional measurement approaches, especially for rare diseases and conditions where traditional endpoints are problematic.

**Reproducibility issues**: The "difficult to measure" problem manifests in ongoing concerns about reproducibility in preclinical research, with many published findings failing to translate to clinical settings, validating the article's caution about measurement challenges.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article didn't contain explicit predictions. It was more of a reflection on enduring challenges in drug discovery, emphasizing the need for balanced approaches to measurement and skepticism.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 3/9**

This article provides a thoughtful conceptual framework for understanding persistent challenges in drug discovery, but it's largely philosophical rather than prescriptive. The core insight about directing skepticism appropriately remains relevant but has been discussed extensively elsewhere in different contexts.
