# A Painful Cancer Advertisement (August 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The op‑ed by Matt Jablow in the *New York Times* recounts the loss of his wife Ronna to late‑stage non‑small‑cell lung cancer (NSCLC). She received Opdivo (nivolumab), a PD‑1 checkpoint inhibitor, but saw no clinical benefit. Jablow objects to the TV commercials that promote Opdivo as a life‑extending therapy, arguing that the ads are misleading because only a minority of patients respond and the median survival gain is only a few months. He cites a NEJM study reporting a ~20 % response rate in heavily pre‑treated patients and stresses that the overall five‑year survival for stage IV NSCLC remains 1–5 %. He also notes that efficacy appears to depend on PD‑L1 expression, contrasting Bristol‑Myers Squibb’s (BMS) broader‑population trials with Merck’s (Keytruda) biomarker‑selected approach. The piece ends with a call for more honest advertising that acknowledges the need for PD‑L1 testing and the fact that many patients will not benefit.

## 2. HISTORY  

**Regulatory approvals and label evolution (2016‑2025)**  
| Year | Drug | Key approvals for NSCLC | Biomarker requirement |
|------|------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| 2015 | Nivolumab (Opdivo) | Second‑line squamous NSCLC (CheckMate 017) and non‑squamous NSCLC (CheckMate 057) | No PD‑L1 requirement (broad population) |
| 2016 | Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) | First‑line for PD‑L1 ≥ 50 % (KEYNOTE‑024) | Mandatory PD‑L1 IHC ≥ 50 % |
| 2018 | Nivolumab + ipilimumab (CheckMate 227) | First‑line for PD‑L1 ≥ 1 % (later withdrawn in US) | PD‑L1 ≥ 1 % (initially) |
| 2018‑2020 | Combination chemo‑immunotherapy (Keytruda + platinum doublet; Opdivo + chemo) | First‑line for all histologies regardless of PD‑L1 | No PD‑L1 prerequisite for chemo‑combo |
| 2020‑2022 | Atezolizumab (Tecentriq) and durvalumab (Imfinzi) | First‑line with chemo; adjuvant setting (2020‑2021) | No PD‑L1 requirement for chemo‑combo; PD‑L1 ≥ 1 % for monotherapy |
| 2023 | Nivolumab + chemotherapy (CheckMate 9LA) | First‑line for all patients | No PD‑L1 requirement |
| 2024 | FDA issues guidance on “patient‑population‑specific” language in oncology ads, urging sponsors to disclose biomarker eligibility when relevant. | – | – |

**Clinical outcomes**  
* **Monotherapy**: Long‑term follow‑up of CheckMate 057 (nivolumab) and KEYNOTE‑024 (pembrolizumab) showed 5‑year overall survival (OS) of ~16 % in the respective trial arms, compared with ~5 % for standard chemotherapy. Median OS gains were ≈ 4–5 months in the overall intent‑to‑treat populations, but in PD‑L1‑high subgroups (≥ 50 %) pembrolizumab achieved median OS > 30 months.  
* **Combination therapy**: Adding platinum‑based chemotherapy to PD‑1 blockade increased median OS to 15–20 months across all PD‑L1 levels, with 5‑year OS now approaching 12–15 % in real‑world registries.  
* **Real‑world uptake**: By 2023, > 70 % of newly diagnosed stage IV NSCLC patients in the United States received some form of immunotherapy (either monotherapy or combo), driven largely by the chemo‑immunotherapy approvals that removed the need for PD‑L1 testing for eligibility.  

**Advertising and public perception**  
* The FDA’s 2024 “Oncologic Advertising Guidance” required that any claim of “extending life” be accompanied by a quantitative context (e.g., “median overall survival improved by 4 months in clinical trials”) and, when a biomarker is essential for benefit, a statement that “benefit is most pronounced in patients whose tumors express PD‑L1.”  
* Despite the guidance, many TV spots for Opdivo and Keytruda continued to use broad language (“helps patients live longer”) until the companies voluntarily revised scripts in early 2025 after a coalition of patient‑advocacy groups filed complaints with the Federal Trade Commission.  

**Scientific advances**  
* Biomarker refinement: Beyond PD‑L1 IHC, tumor mutational burden (TMB) and gene‑expression signatures were incorporated into trial designs, but none have yet replaced PD‑L1 as a regulatory companion diagnostic.  
* New indications: Nivolumab received FDA approval (2022) for adjuvant treatment of resected NSCLC with PD‑L1 ≥ 1 %, and pembrolizumab secured adjuvant approval (2023) for all resected stage IB‑IIIA disease, further expanding the patient pool.  

**Business impact**  
* BMS’s Opdivo sales peaked in 2019 (~ $4 bn globally) and have gradually declined to ≈ $2.5 bn in 2024 as combination regimens and competing PD‑1/PD‑L1 antibodies captured market share.  
* Merck’s Keytruda has become the top‑selling oncology drug worldwide, driven by its first‑line PD‑L1‑selected indication and the later chemo‑combo label.  

Overall, the landscape that Jablow described in 2016 has shifted dramatically: checkpoint inhibitors are now standard of care, survival has modestly improved, and regulatory/advertising practices have been nudged toward greater transparency, but the core tension—high expectations versus variable individual benefit—remains.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction (from the op‑ed or implied) | What actually happened |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Only ~20 % of heavily pre‑treated stage IV NSCLC patients respond to Opdivo; median life extension ≈ 3 months.** | The original CheckMate 057 trial reported an objective response rate (ORR) of 19 % and a median OS gain of 3.5 months versus docetaxel. Subsequent long‑term data confirm a modest median benefit in the unselected second‑line population. |
| **Efficacy depends on PD‑L1 expression; patients lacking the biomarker see little to no benefit.** | Confirmed. In first‑line trials, pembrolizumab monotherapy showed ORR ≈ 45 % and median OS > 30 months in PD‑L1 ≥ 50 % patients, but ORR fell to < 15 % in PD‑L1 < 1 % cohorts. Nivolumab’s benefit in low‑expressors was modest, prompting the shift to chemo‑combo regimens that do not require PD‑L1 testing. |
| **Advertising will continue to portray the drugs as broadly effective, causing distress to families like the Jablow’s.** | Partially true. Ads remained broadly worded through 2023, but the 2024 FDA guidance forced sponsors to add qualifying language. Patient‑advocacy pressure led to revised scripts in 2025, reducing the most egregious over‑promising. |
| **Future “better therapies” will emerge, making the current disappointment more painful.** | Accurate. Since 2016, multiple checkpoint inhibitors, combination regimens, and novel modalities (e.g., bispecific antibodies, CAR‑T for solid tumors) have entered trials, raising expectations. However, the incremental survival gains remain modest for most patients. |
| **The “redefinition” of what counts as an impressive oncology result will continue.** | True. Median OS improvements of 3–5 months are now routinely accepted for late‑line agents, whereas earlier (pre‑2010) approvals often required larger absolute gains. The bar has lowered, reflecting the difficulty of achieving dramatic cures in advanced solid tumors. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article captures a poignant, personal view of the early immunotherapy era and highlights a regulatory/ethical issue (advertising truthfulness) that has shaped policy and practice over the past decade. Its relevance persists, though the technical details are now largely historical.
