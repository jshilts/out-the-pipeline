# Another Look At Marketing Vs. R&D In Pharma (May 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article attempts to debunk the widespread belief that pharmaceutical companies spend more on marketing than on research and development. It uses Pfizer as a case study, noting that the company spent $622 million on advertising in 2012 and estimating total marketing expenditures around $5 billion (including physician detailing), while spending $7.9 billion on R&D. The author cites industry-wide 2010 figures showing $31+ billion on total marketing versus $67 billion on R&D. The article emphasizes that marketing expenditures are intended to generate revenue that funds research, and that while some marketing practices can be problematic, the popular narrative of drug companies being primarily marketing operations with small research departments is inaccurate.

## 2. HISTORY

In the years following this article, several developments reshaped pharmaceutical marketing and R&D dynamics:

**Regulatory and Policy Changes:** The Physician Payments Sunshine Act (part of the Affordable Care Act) began requiring public disclosure of industry payments to physicians starting in 2013, bringing unprecedented transparency to pharmaceutical marketing practices. This created a more restrained marketing environment.

**R&D Productivity Challenges:** The pharmaceutical industry continued facing declining R&D productivity, with increasing costs per new drug approval. By 2016, estimates showed the cost to develop a new drug had risen dramatically from earlier figures, making the $43M figure referenced in the article increasingly obsolete.

**Marketing Shift:** Direct-to-consumer advertising faced growing criticism and regulatory scrutiny. Many companies began scaling back DTC spending, focusing more on digital and physician-targeted approaches. Companies like Pfizer indeed maintained significant marketing expenditures, but the mix shifted toward medical education and physician engagement rather than mass consumer advertising.

**Industry Consolidation:** Pfizer's approach to R&D evolved through multiple large-scale mergers and acquisitions, including the attempted acquisition of AstraZeneca in 2014 (unsuccessful), the acquisition of Hospira in 2015, and the major merger with Wyeth in 2009 (before this article). This reflected the industry trend of acquiring innovation rather than solely relying on internal R&D.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article does not contain explicit forward-looking predictions, but rather defends a position about contemporary marketing versus R&D spending that had implications for how these trends might develop. The underlying assumptions can be evaluated:

- **Implicit assumption:** That the marketing vs. R&D spending ratio would remain relatively stable
  - **Outcome:** R&D spending for major pharma companies has generally remained substantial compared to marketing, but the definition and reporting of these categories evolved with increased transparency requirements

- **Implicit expectation:** That rational economic behavior (marketing generating revenue to fund research) would continue driving industry structure
  - **Outcome:** This fundamental dynamic persisted, but with greater external scrutiny and regulatory oversight of marketing practices

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

The article addresses a persistent misconception in pharmaceutical economics with concrete data, but the specific numerical analysis became dated rather quickly as industry practices and disclosure requirements evolved post-2013. The broader conceptual point about marketing needing to generate returns that fund research remains relevant.
