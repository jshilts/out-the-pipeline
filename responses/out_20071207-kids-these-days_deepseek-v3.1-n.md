# Kids These Days! (December 2007)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses an incident where chemist Fred Menger believed he had discovered a new 12-membered ring compound, but German chemist Manfred Christl pointed out he had actually rediscovered the 102-year-old Zincke reaction first described in 1904. The mistake arose from misinterpretation of mass spectrometry data, where a 6-membered ring appeared as a larger 12-membered ring due to fragment clustering effects. Menger had to submit a correction acknowledging Zincke's original work. Christl criticized the incident as evidence that modern researchers, especially younger scientists, fail to conduct proper literature searches, preferring to stay at their computers rather than consulting traditional handbooks, and that peer reviewers are overloaded and miss obvious prior art. The author (Derek Lowe) counters this argument by pointing out that even modern digital tools and recent literature searches should have caught the error, noting that a 2006 review in the same journal (Angewandte Chemie) would have revealed the Zincke reaction, and that Google and Wikipedia could easily have found the relevant information.

## 2. HISTORY

The case highlighted broader ongoing challenges in scientific research that have persisted and evolved in the digital age. Menger's correction was published, acknowledging the Zincke reaction rediscovery. This incident served as one of many cautionary tales about inadequate literature review in chemistry. Over the subsequent 17 years, the Zincke reaction remained a well-established method in organic synthesis for converting pyridinium salts to N-substituted pyridinium compounds, though it did not become a major drug discovery method or lead to novel therapeutics. The reaction continued to be referenced in synthetic chemistry contexts, but it did not result in new FDA-approved drugs or become a broadly applied industrial pharmaceutical method.

The broader issue of literature neglect that Christl highlighted has persisted and arguably intensified in the era of information overload. Peer review challenges have grown more acute with the exponential increase in scientific publications, making thorough literature checking increasingly difficult for reviewers. The specific concerns about younger researchers not using "dusty handbooks" became less relevant as relevant information migrated online, but the fundamental problem of inadequate literature searching remains a persistent concern in scientific publishing, with rediscovery of known chemistry continuing to occur despite improved search tools. No major changes in scientific publishing policies or drug development programs specifically resulted from this incident.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **Christl's Concern: Young researchers abandoning handbooks to work only at computers.**
  - Outcome: This concern became somewhat moot as chemical handbooks and historical literature digitally migrated online (SciFinder, Reaxys) from 2007-2024, making the distinction between electronic and physical literature less relevant.

- **Christl's Assertion: Old reactions continue to be rediscovered due to scientists not doing historical literature research.**
  - Outcome: This prediction proved accurate, as cases of "scooped" chemistry continued to appear in the literature, though improved databases and structure-searchable tools reduced the most obvious cases.

- **Lowe's Counterargument: Modern literature search tools should prevent basic mistakes like this.**
  - Outcome: Lowe's point was well-founded, but even advanced tools did not eliminate the fundamental problem of superficial literature review, which persisted as a challenge in the field.

- **Implicit Prediction: This case would improve awareness about thorough literature searching.**
  - Outcome: The incident entered the lore of problematic oversight in chemistry, but it did not lead to major systemic changes in how peer review or literature searching is conducted at the institutional or journal level.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This article addresses a niche technical error and broader literature review challenges in chemistry that lack broader biomedical or biotechnology significance, limited in interest primarily to methodological discussions in organic chemistry publishing.
