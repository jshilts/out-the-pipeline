# Bad News - But Not the Unexpected Kind (September 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses two biotech companies that faced clinical failures on September 26, 2017. First, Axovant Sciences' Alzheimer's drug intepirdine, a 5-HT6 receptor ligand acquired from GSK, failed its Phase 3 trial - an outcome the author considered predictable given that both Pfizer and Lundbeck had already abandoned similar 5-HT6 Alzheimer's candidates. The author had taken a short position on Axovant stock and profited from the failure. Second, PTC Therapeutics faced FDA rejection for ataluren (PTC124) for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, with the FDA documenting repeated negative trials and stating the drug showed no evidence of effectiveness. The author praised FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb for maintaining evidence-based standards by rejecting drugs without proven efficacy, while criticizing the hype-driven investment in companies promoting unproven therapies.

## 2. HISTORY

**Axovant/Intepirdine:** The September 2017 failure of intepirdine marked the end of Axovant's lead program. Following this failure, Axovant pivoted to gene therapy, eventually rebranding as **Sio Gene Therapies** in 2020. The company shifted focus to treating GM1 gangliosidosis and GM2 gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs/Sandhoff diseases) with gene therapies AXO-AAV-GM1 and AXO-AAV-GM2. However, these programs also failed - in January 2023, Sio announced both programs missed primary endpoints in Phase 1/2 trials. The company subsequently underwent strategic review and delisted from NASDAQ, essentially ending operations by mid-2023. The broader 5-HT6 receptor approach for Alzheimer's was largely abandoned industry-wide, with no approved drugs using this mechanism.

**PTC Therapeutics/Ataluren:** Despite the FDA's strong negative stance in 2017, ataluren did eventually receive **conditional approval in Europe** (under brand name Translarna) for DMD in patients with nonsense mutations, though it remains **unapproved in the United States**. The European approval has been controversial and subject to ongoing review. Clinical data remained mixed, with some studies showing modest benefits while others showed no significant effects. The drug continues to be marketed in some countries outside the US, generating revenue for PTC. However, it has not become a standard-of-care treatment, and PTC has faced criticism for pricing (estimated annual cost of \~$300,000) relative to uncertain benefits. PTC has since diversified their pipeline, including acquiring the spinal muscular atrophy drug Evrysdi (risdiplam) from Roche, which has had more clinical success.

**Regulatory Impact:** Scott Gottlieb's FDA maintained relatively strict evidence standards during his tenure (2017-2019), setting precedents that influenced subsequent regulatory decisions. The rejection of ataluren became a case study in the FDA's unwillingness to approve drugs based on post-hoc analyses of negative trials.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Axovant will continue to fail (implicit):** ✓ **ACCURATE**. The article's skepticism about intepirdine was validated when the drug failed completely. More broadly, Axovant's subsequent pivot to gene therapy also failed, and the company ultimately ceased operations - worse than even the author likely expected.

• **PTC's FDA hearing "will not go well":** ✓ **ACCURATE**. The FDA advisory committee meeting indeed went poorly for PTC, maintaining the agency's rejection of ataluren for US markets.

• **The FDA under Gottlieb would maintain evidence standards despite concerns about being "too permissive":** ✓ **ACCURATE**. The FDA's decision reinforced that evidence thresholds remained high, and subsequent regulatory decisions during Gottlieb's tenure generally maintained these standards.

• **The ataluren situation represented solid evidence of failure, not just lack of evidence:** ✓ **ACCURATE**. The drug's limited efficacy was confirmed by its failure to gain US approval and its mixed performance even in markets where it received conditional approval.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article demonstrates strong industry analysis and foresight, correctly predicting both failures while highlighting systemic issues in biotech investment and regulatory decision-making. The long-term outcomes - including Axovant's complete collapse and ataluren's continuing controversy - make it both prescient and educationally valuable for understanding evidence standards and biotech business models.
