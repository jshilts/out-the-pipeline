# The New Groupthink and the Assault on Solitude (January 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This blog post from Science magazine's "Pipeline" column discusses an op-ed in the New York Times by Susan Cain about "the New Groupthink"—the trend toward open offices, teamwork, and collaboration in workplace culture. The article highlights research suggesting that true creativity often arises from solitude and that many highly creative people are introverted. The author identifies personally with needing quiet, uninterrupted time to think deeply before being ready to discuss ideas with others. The piece questions the one-size-fits-all approach to workplace design and culture, advocating for environments that accommodate different working styles—both for people who thrive in collaborative settings and those who need privacy and quiet to do their best work.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this 2012 article, several significant developments occurred:

**Open office backlash intensified**: Research published after 2012 consistently showed negative effects of open offices. A 2018 Harvard Business School study found that face-to-face interactions actually *decreased* by roughly 70% in open offices while electronic communications increased, directly contradicting the claimed benefits. Numerous workplace surveys showed widespread employee dissatisfaction with open-plan environments.

**Scientific evidence accumulated**: Subsequent studies confirmed the article's concerns about interruptions and productivity. Research showed that it takes an average of 23 minutes to regain deep focus after an interruption, and that open offices increase stress hormones and decrease motivation.

**COVID-19 pandemic impact**: The 2020-2021 pandemic dramatically shifted workplace dynamics. Remote work became widespread, giving many workers unprecedented control over their environment and quiet time for focused work. This experience forced many organizations to reconsider both remote work policies and the necessity of open offices.

**Mixed adoption trends**: While some tech companies doubled down on open office designs, other organizations began incorporating more privacy options, quiet rooms, and hybrid work arrangements. The pendulum swung toward more flexible, diverse workplace arrangements rather than pure open-office models.

No major policy changes or drug development connections emerged from this workplace design discussion, as it was primarily about scientific workplace effectiveness rather than biotechnology applications or medical outcomes.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
**Prediction**: The article implied that organizations would recognize the need for diverse workplace environments accommodating both collaborative and quiet spaces.

**Actual outcome**: ✅ **Partially correct** - Many organizations did incorporate more flexible designs, but open offices remained widespread, especially in tech and startups. The pandemic accelerated recognition of diverse work styles, but complete reversal of the trend didn't occur.

**Prediction**: Implicit suggestion that research would continue supporting the value of solitude for creative work.

**Actual outcome**: ✅ **Correct** - Subsequent years saw numerous studies confirming that privacy and lack of interruption enhance creativity and productivity, particularly for complex cognitive work.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**

This article represents a modest contribution to workplace design discourse, addressing issues relevant to scientific productivity but with limited long-term impact on biotechnology trends directly. While the topic gained some additional attention during the pandemic, it ranks in the lower-middle tier for lasting importance to the biotech field specifically.
