# Publish, Then Perish (November 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

This personal blog post from a medicinal/organic chemist describes their situation after being laid off from a pharmaceutical company ("Wonder Drug Factory"). The author mentions they have severance that will carry them into the following year and expresses gratitude for support during their job search.

The main scientific content concerns an opportunistic side project the author was able to advance due to the "rapid end of normal research work." They describe running experiments on "off-the-radar samples" and express ambition to publish these results quickly in a high-profile journal. The author solicits advice on whether to target specialty chemistry journals (*Angewandte Chemie* or *JACS*), premier multidisciplinary journals (*Science* or *Nature*), or other venues like *PNAS*, acknowledging it's difficult for readers to assess without knowing the project details.

## 2. HISTORY

This appears to be a personal blog post from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog (hosted at science.org at that time), which has been running since the early 2000s and continues today. Lowe is a medicinal chemist and pharmaceutical industry commentator whose blog became highly influential in the chemistry and drug discovery communities.

Regarding the specific research project mentioned: without access to the actual research details or subsequent publications, it's impossible to determine what discoveries emerged from these "off-the-radar samples" or where they were ultimately published. Many pharmaceutical researchers leaving companies during layoffs do pursue side projects, with variable outcomes. The biotech and pharmaceutical industries experienced significant consolidation and layoffs in the mid-2000s period, including major company mergers and site closures.

Lowe's blog itself continued and gained prominence, becoming one of the most-read industry commentary sites covering drug discovery, pharmaceutical R&D, and chemistry. However, I cannot confidently state specific details about this particular research project's outcome.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**No explicit predictions** about biotechnology or pharmaceutical industry trends appear in this article. The piece is primarily personal narrative about a job transition and publication strategy rather than predictive commentary about industry directions, drug development outcomes, or technological advances.

The author's implicit prediction about publishing in high-tier journals cannot be evaluated without knowing the research topic and whether publication occurred.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

While historically interesting as a snapshot of the personal side of pharmaceutical industry employment in 2006, this article contains no substantive analysis of biotechnology trends, drug development outcomes, or industry predictions that would make it highly informative for understanding biotech evolution. It's primarily a personal career update with limited technical or industry-wide insight.
