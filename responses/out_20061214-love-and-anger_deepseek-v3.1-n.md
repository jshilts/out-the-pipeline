# Love and Anger (December 2006)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2006 commentary responds to a debate about the pharmaceutical industry's reputation and scientific capabilities. Glenn Reynolds defended drug companies against political criticism, while blogger Dean Esmay raised ethical concerns. The author particularly disputes a comment from Jerry Kindall asserting that drug discovery had evolved from a "crap-shoot" into a targeted, predictable process through sophisticated computer modeling—claiming that molecular design could precisely target chemical receptors.

The author strongly contradicts this optimism, arguing that drug discovery remained as much of a gamble as ever despite advances in computational tools. They point to disappointing results from computational modeling efforts as evidence that the field had not achieved the precision and predictability that some commentators believed.

## 2. HISTORY

**Continued Challenges in Drug Discovery:** In the two decades following this article, the fundamental difficulties of drug discovery persisted. Despite massive investments in computational approaches, molecular modeling, and AI-driven drug design, the pharmaceutical industry continued to face high failure rates in clinical trials. 

**Rise and Reality of Computational Drug Design:** Companies like Schrödinger, Atomwise, and DeepMind entered the space with computational platforms, and while they achieved notable successes (such as DeepMind's AlphaFold breakthrough in protein structure prediction in 2020), these advances did not eliminate the "crap-shoot" nature of drug discovery. Drug approval rates remained challenging, with approximately 90% of candidates still failing in clinical development through the 2010s and early 2020s.

**FDA Trends and Drug Development:** The FDA approved drugs continued to emerge from both traditional discovery methods and computational approaches, but no computational platform truly revolutionized the fundamental success rates across the industry. Pharmaceutical companies increasingly adopted AI and computational tools, but these became part of larger workflows rather than replacing empirical research.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"Drug discovery is getting more targeted through sophisticated computer modeling"**: This prediction proved partially correct in that computational tools became widespread, but **overly optimistic** about eliminating uncertainty. While computational approaches became standard in pharmaceutical companies, drug discovery remained highly unpredictable with continued high attrition rates.

• **Implicit prediction that receptor-targeted design would become highly successful**: **Mixed results**. While structure-based drug design had notable successes, many drug targets proved more complex than simple lock-and-key receptor models, with off-target effects, delivery challenges, and biological complexity confounding predictions.

• **Author's counter-prediction that "drug discovery is just as much of a crap-shoot as ever"**: This proved **largely accurate**. Despite technological advances, the fundamental biological complexity and unpredictability of drug development persisted through 2024, with high R&D costs and failure rates remaining industry-defining challenges.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

The article captures a prescient debate about computational drug discovery's real capabilities versus hype—a tension that remained relevant for decades. The author's skepticism about computational revolution proved more accurate than the optimistic predictions, highlighting important industry challenges.
