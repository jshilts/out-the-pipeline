# Not So Many Uncited Papers, Actually (February 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary challenges the popular notion that a large percentage of scientific papers are never cited. The article notes that earlier studies from the 1990s suggested alarmingly high rates of uncited papers (55% within five years for 1981-1985 publications), but argues these figures were misleading because they included editorial material like letters, corrections, and meeting abstracts that wouldn't normally be cited.

When analysis focuses only on research papers and review articles using a ten-year timeframe, uncited rates drop significantly: biomedical papers show 4% uncited, chemistry 8%, and physics 11%. However, removing self-citations increases rates—the overall ten-year uncited rate across disciplines excluding self-citation is approximately 18%. The author notes this rate has been declining over the years, likely due to better search technology and longer reference lists.

The commentary highlights that citation databases often undercount due to data-entry errors and incomplete indexing, and that papers get viewed/downloaded far more frequently than they get cited. The article acknowledges a "dark matter" problem with predatory journals, where citation rates are likely abysmal, but the author argues against counting such publications as legitimate scientific papers.

## 2. HISTORY
Subsequent to this 2018 article, several developments have reshaped citation analysis and confirmed some of the article's core arguments:

**Research assessment reforms (2018-2023)**: The Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), first signed in 2012, gained significant traction after 2018, with major funding agencies and institutions moving away from journal-based metrics toward more nuanced evaluation criteria. This shift acknowledged limitations of citation metrics as primary indicators of research quality.

**Citizen science and altmetrics growth**: Alternative metrics (altmetrics) tracking social media mentions, policy citations, and public engagement became more sophisticated, providing additional evidence that papers have impact beyond formal citations. Science communication platforms like The Conversation and institutional repositories expanded, making research more accessible and potentially citable.

**Open Access expansion**: The Plan S initiative launched in 2018 required immediate open access for publicly funded research, dramatically increasing public access to papers. This likely contributed to further declines in uncited rates by removing paywall barriers.

**COVID-19 research acceleration (2020-2021)**: The pandemic created an unprecedented surge in scientific publishing, with preprints and rapid publication models becoming mainstream. This highlighted how quickly papers could gain citations when relevant to urgent global problems, but also raised concerns about research quality and reproducibility.

**Retraction crisis and research integrity**: High-profile retractions increased scrutiny of citation metrics, with studies showing that even retracted papers continue accumulating citations. This led to calls for better integration of retraction status in citation databases.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
No explicit predictions were made in this article, as it was primarily a commentary on existing citation data and trends. The article's main contribution was correcting misconceptions about uncited literature rather than forecasting future developments. The author noted a continuing decline in uncited rates due to improved search technology, which has likely continued, but did not make specific future predictions about citation patterns or scholarly communication.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **4/10**

This article addresses an important but niche methodological issue in scientometrics—the accuracy of citation analysis—which has practical implications for research evaluation but limited broader impact on science policy or practice compared to other scientific topics.
