# Hybrid Biomolecules, Edible And Not (June 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the chemistry of Olestra, a "fake fat" developed by Procter & Gamble. Fats are triglycerides consisting of glycerol esterified with three fatty acids; the body digests them by cleaving the ester bonds. Olestra is a sucrose molecule esterified with fatty acids. Because the body's enzymes have evolved to recognize glycerol-based esters, they cannot cleave Olestra, so it passes through the digestive tract unmetabolized. This led to side effects such as gastrointestinal issues and malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Despite extensive human testing showing no participation in metabolic pathways, Olestra was a commercial failure.

The author speculates on hybrid biomolecules that combine sugars, glycerol, and peptides in novel ester linkages not found in nature, and he notes that esterified serine is rare compared to phosphorylation. He rhetorically pictures an alien life-form using sucrose esters for energy storage, digesting Olestra while finding our triglycerides indigestible.

## 2. HISTORY

Olestra (brand name Olean) was approved by the FDA in 1996 for use in savory snacks. Its adoption in the marketplace was limited and it is widely viewed as a commercial failure, primarily due to consumer concerns about gastrointestinal side effects (cramping, loose stools, "anal leakage") and restrictive labeling requirements. While Procter & Gamble claimed taste and texture parity, sales remained low. Products made with Olestra largely disappeared from major markets over the following decade, and the ingredient is not widely used in foods today.

The scientific and regulatory consensus remains that Olestra is not metabolized and does not participate in human biochemical pathways; subsequent research did not overturn this conclusion. Studies confirmed it sequesters fat-soluble vitamins and other lipophilic compounds (e.g., PCBs), reducing their absorption. Olestra did not become a broadly adopted solution for fat replacement in the food supply, and no major new consumer-health applications emerged. Public concerns about highly processed food ingredients also grew during this period, further limiting market opportunities for synthetic fat substitutes. No significant policy changes or industry-wide shifts resulted from Olestra after the article's publication.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make explicit forward-looking predictions about Olestra or related technologies. It characterized Olestra as a market failure at the time of writing and explored the biochemical reasons for its indigestibility. The speculation about alien biochemistry was rhetorical and not intended as a testable forecast.

Consequently, there are no concrete predictions to evaluate against real-world outcomes. The underlying premise that Olestra would remain indigestible and physiologically inert has held true, and no enzymes capable of digesting sucrose fatty-acid polyesters have appeared in the human population or as commercial products in food science.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **2/10**

The article is a light, speculative reflection on Olestra's chemistry rather than a research or biotechnology-focused commentary. It lacks direct relevance to biotechnology industry developments, targeted therapeutic programs, policy, or clinical outcomes, and did not identify new pathways or methods that materialized.
