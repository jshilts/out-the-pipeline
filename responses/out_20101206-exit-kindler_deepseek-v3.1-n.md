# Exit Kindler (December 2010)

## 1. SUMMARY
This commentary discusses the sudden departure of Jeff Kindler as CEO of Pfizer in December 2010, to be replaced by Ian Read. The author notes that Kindler's exit appeared abrupt and unplanned, suggesting he may have been pushed out rather than voluntarily retiring. The article characterizes Pfizer as having had a "horrendous time" under Kindler's tenure, facing major challenges including the looming patent expiration of Lipitor (the company's blockbuster cholesterol drug) and poor research productivity. The Wyeth acquisition is presented as another large-scale merger that failed to solve Pfizer's fundamental problems. The author expresses skepticism that changing CEOs would significantly improve Pfizer's trajectory, given the company's massive size, entrenched "acquire-your-way-out-of-trouble" strategy, and the long timelines required for research pipeline improvements to materialize.

## 2. HISTORY
Following Kindler's departure, Ian Read served as Pfizer CEO from 2010-2019, then as Executive Chairman until 2020. Under Read, Pfizer continued major acquisitions including:

**AstraZeneca bid (2014)**: Pfizer made a $118 billion hostile takeover attempt, which was ultimately abandoned after political opposition in the UK.

**Hospira acquisition (2015)**: Pfizer acquired the injectable drugs and biosimilars company for $17 billion, expanding into hospital products and generic biologics.

**Medivation acquisition (2016)**: Pfizer purchased the cancer drug company for $14 billion, gaining prostate cancer drug Xtandi.

Perhaps most significantly, Read oversaw the strategic decision to pursue smaller, disease-area focused acquisitions rather than massive mergers. In 2019, Read was succeeded by Albert Bourla.

The Lipitor patent expiration in 2011 did cause significant revenue decline as predicted - the drug had generated over $10 billion annually at its peak. Pfizer's stock largely tracked or modestly outperformed the broader pharmaceutical index during Read's tenure, but research productivity remained a persistent challenge.

During Read's leadership, Pfizer brought several important drugs to market including Ibrance (breast cancer, approved 2015), Eliquis (anticoagulant, with BMS, approved 2012), Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis, approved 2012), and the COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty (with BioNTech, approved 2021).

The "acquire-your-way-out-of-trouble" strategy persisted but shifted toward more targeted acquisitions rather than mega-mergers. Pfizer continued to face the underlying research productivity challenges the article identified.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Prediction**: Changing CEOs wouldn't affect things much due to Pfizer's enormous size and the Lipitor patent cliff.
  **Reality**: Mixed. Pfizer successfully navigated the Lipitor patent expiration through portfolio diversification, cost-cutting, and strategic acquisitions, but core research productivity challenges persisted throughout Read's tenure.

• **Prediction**: Even with a "magic wand effect on research productivity," a new CEO wouldn't be in the job long enough (10-12 years) to see pipeline effects.
  **Reality**: Accurate in part. Read served 9 years as CEO (2010-2019) and did oversee development of important drugs that launched during his tenure, but fundamental R&D productivity transformation remained elusive.

• **Prediction**: Reversing the "acquire-your-way-out-of-trouble" strategy would be very difficult, "like trying to unbake a cake."
  **Reality**: Partially correct. Pfizer continued major acquisitions under Read but shifted toward more targeted deals rather than mega-mergers, suggesting some strategic evolution was possible.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 6**

This article represents a perceptive real-time analysis of a major pharmaceutical leadership transition, correctly identifying the structural challenges that would persist regardless of CEO changes, though it may have underestimated the potential for strategic evolution within the existing acquisition-driven model.
