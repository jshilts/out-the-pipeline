# Thought for the Day, On Interdisciplinary Research (March 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article by Derek Lowe reflects on a quote from Nobel laureate Professor Leggett, who criticized the trend of promoting interdisciplinary research "for its own sake." Leggett argued that interdisciplinarity is often treated as a "sauce" that can be poured over "unpromising ingredients" to make them better—an approach he viewed as misguided. The article notes that while physics-biology crossovers have a distinguished history (including Schrödinger's "What is Life?", contributions by George Gamow to DNA research, Francis Crick's physics background, and Richard Feynman's work in Max Delbrück's lab), simply attacking biological problems from a physics perspective isn't inherently virtuous. Lowe concludes that while valuable discoveries emerge from interdisciplinary borderlands, merely crossing disciplinary boundaries doesn't guarantee success.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2013 article, the debate around interdisciplinary research continued to evolve with significant developments:

**Research Funding and Policy Evolution**: Major funding agencies doubled down on interdisciplinary mandates. The NSF continued its Integrative NSF Support Promoting Interdisciplinary Research and Education (INSPIRE) program, while NIH maintained and expanded cross-institute initiatives. However, by the late 2010s, some researchers began reporting that review processes still favored traditional disciplinary work, despite stated interdisciplinary goals.

**CRISPR and Gene Editing**: The period after 2013 saw the explosive growth of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, a field that exemplified successful interdisciplinary research combining microbiology, biochemistry, structural biology, and genetics. Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier's work demonstrated how insights from seemingly disparate fields (bacterial immune systems and RNA biology) could revolutionize biotechnology and medicine. Multiple CRISPR-based therapies entered clinical trials, with the first FDA approval for sickle cell disease treatment occurring in 2023.

**Quantitative Biology and Computational Approaches**: The 2013-2023 decade witnessed substantial growth in computational biology, bioinformatics, and systems biology, with physics-trained researchers making important contributions to protein folding prediction (DeepMind's AlphaFold in 2020), single-cell genomics, and quantitative cell biology. These fields became increasingly mainstream rather than existing at the margins.

**Structural Biology Advances**: Cryo-electron microscopy experienced revolutionary improvements after 2013, enabling atomic-resolution structures of previously intractable biological complexes. This physics-derived technique, developed by researchers like Richard Henderson, Joachim Frank, and Jacques Dubochet (Nobel Prize 2017), became standard in structural biology labs worldwide.

**Academic Institutional Changes**: Many universities continued reorganizing to promote interdisciplinary work, creating joint departments, shared facilities, and cross-school initiatives. However, tenure and promotion criteria often remained stubbornly disciplinary, creating career challenges for researchers working between fields.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article didn't make explicit forward-looking predictions, but rather offered a cautionary perspective on the trend toward forced interdisciplinary research. Professor Leggett's concerns about interdisciplinarity being promoted "for its own sake" and treated as a "magic sauce" proved prescient in some respects but also missed the genuine convergence occurring in certain domains:

- **Concerns about forced interdisciplinary**: Leggett's worry that committees would promote interdisciplinarity without substance was partially borne out. Many funding agencies continued to emphasize interdisciplinary proposals, sometimes leading to superficial combinations rather than genuine synthesis.

- **Value of genuine interdisciplinary work**: The emergence of fields like CRISPR applications, quantitative biology, and advanced structural biology after 2013 showed that when interdisciplinary work addresses real scientific problems rather than being pursued for bureaucratic reasons, transformative results can occur.

- **The "borderlands" perspective**: Lowe's observation that great things emerge from the borderlands between sciences was validated by developments in synthetic biology, precision medicine, and computational drug discovery during this period. However, success typically required the interdisciplinary work to be problem-driven rather than methodology-driven.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article addresses an important ongoing tension in how scientific research is organized and funded, with implications that played out over the subsequent decade in research policy, institutional structures, and breakthrough discoveries that genuinely benefited from interdisciplinary integration.
