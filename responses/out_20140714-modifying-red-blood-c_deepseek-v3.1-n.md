# Modifying Red Blood Cells As Carriers (July 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
This article discusses using red blood cells (RBCs) as therapeutic delivery vehicles—an idea that had been in development for several years. Previous attempts involved forcing compounds into cells (which damaged them) or using antibodies on RBC surfaces (with mixed success). The article highlights a PNAS paper from the Lodish and Ploegh groups at Whitehead/MIT reporting a more sophisticated approach: engineering RBC surface proteins (like glycophorin A) to serve as substrates for sortase-mediated labeling. In irradiated mice implanted with modified fetal cells, up to 50% of circulating RBCs were engineered, with ~85% sortase-labeling efficiency and weeks-long circulation without significant viability loss—a marked improvement over prior methods. The team demonstrated attachment of biotin tags, antibodies, and even dual C- and N-terminal labels. The envisioned applications include targeted drug delivery to specific tissues or tumors, combined cytosolic loading with surface targeting modules, and diagnostic imaging with radioisotopes.

## 2. HISTORY
RBC-based therapeutic carriers have seen continued research and some clinical translation over the past decade, though with mixed commercial success:

**Scientific/Clinical Developments:**
- Sortase-mediated RBC surface modification has remained primarily a research tool rather than a clinically deployed platform. While the enzymatic labeling approach proved robust for ex vivo cell engineering, scaling to clinical-grade manufacturing and meeting regulatory standards proved challenging.

- RBC-hitchhiking (RBC-H) emerged as an adjacent strategy, leveraging natural RBC adhesion to deliver payloads. Studies demonstrated enhanced drug delivery to organs like lungs, liver, and spleen through this approach, with some preclinical success.

- Several companies pursued RBC-based delivery platforms. Erytech Pharma advanced red blood cell-encapsulated asparaginase for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and pancreatic cancer, gaining EMA approval in some markets though facing mixed trial results and eventual financial restructuring.

- Rubius Therapeutics, founded around 2013-2014, developed RED PLATFORM using engineered RBCs for enzyme replacement and cancer therapy. They advanced multiple candidates into clinical trials but ultimately terminated programs due to disappointing efficacy, leading to company wind-down by 2023.

**Regulatory and Clinical Outcomes:**
- No major FDA-approved RBC-targeted therapeutics emerged from the specific sortase modification approach described in the 2014 paper.

- FDA approved CAR-T cell therapies and other cellular therapies proliferated during 2017-2022, but these generally used T cells rather than RBCs as carriers.

- RBC-based approaches faced challenges with consistent manufacturing, immune responses to modified cells, and achieving sufficient therapeutic payload delivery to target tissues.

**Business Impact:**
- Investment in cell therapy focused more heavily on T cells, NK cells, and stem cells rather than RBC engineering platforms.
- The field shifted toward simpler, more scalable delivery systems (LNPs, nanoparticles) and established cellular therapies rather than RBC carriers.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
**Predictions from the article and their outcomes:**

• **Prediction:** "Conjugation of an imaging probe (i.e., a radioisotope), together with such a targeting moiety also could be used for diagnostic purposes."  
**Outcome:** While targeted imaging agents have advanced (particularly in PET imaging), RBC-based diagnostic platforms did not achieve widespread clinical adoption. Most diagnostic imaging continues to use direct molecular probes rather than RBC carriers.

• **Prediction:** "Engineered RBCs loaded with a therapeutic agent in the cytosol and modified on the surface with a cell type-specific recognition module could be used to deliver payloads to a precise tissue or location in the body."  
**Outcome:** Despite continued research, targeted RBC delivery systems failed to demonstrate compelling clinical efficacy. Rubius Therapeutics' oncology programs showed insufficient tumor targeting and efficacy, leading to trial terminations.

• **Prediction:** "The wide variety of possible payloads, ranging from proteins and peptides to synthetic compounds and fluorescent probes, may serve as a guide."  
**Outcome:** While the sortase methodology enabled diverse molecular attachments in research settings, the complexity of regulatory approval for modified cellular products limited this versatility in clinical applications.

• **Bigger Picture:** The vision of RBCs as versatile therapeutic carriers did not materialize at scale. Clinical success in cell therapy concentrated instead in T cell engineering (CAR-T), while drug delivery innovation focused on lipid nanoparticles and simpler targeting strategies. The scientific premise was sound, but practical challenges in manufacturing, immunogenicity, and therapeutic window prevented widespread adoption.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**
The article addresses an innovative biotechnology approach with clear clinical relevance, and the research represents genuine scientific advancement in cellular engineering. However, the limited subsequent clinical translation and eventual commercial failures of RBC carrier companies diminish its long-term importance compared to other cell therapy breakthroughs that achieved widespread patient impact.
