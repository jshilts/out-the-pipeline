# Photochemical Reaction Discovery (16 May 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article highlights a Boston University collaboration between Aaron Beeler and John Porco's research groups using high-powered photochemistry equipment to discover new chemical reactions. They employed a 1000-watt high-pressure mercury lamp with spectral filtering capabilities, operating in both batch and flow modes to irradiate starting materials with various chromophores under different experimental conditions. The work demonstrated multiple photochemical transformations, including photo-Fries rearrangements and 2+2 cycloadditions with sulfonyl migrations. Lowe emphasizes that photochemistry represents a vast, underexplored territory in both reaction and chemical space, suggesting significant potential for discovering novel transformations.

## 2. HISTORY

Following this 2014 publication, photoredox catalysis and photochemical reaction discovery experienced substantial growth in synthetic chemistry:

**Academic Impact**: The period from 2014-2024 saw photoredox catalysis become a mainstream methodology in organic synthesis, with hundreds of research groups worldwide adopting flow photochemistry setups similar to those described. Continuous-flow photochemistry emerged as a key enabling technology, addressing safety concerns and scalability limitations of batch photochemical reactions.

**Drug Discovery Applications**: Photochemical methods became incorporated into medicinal chemistry workflows for late-stage functionalization and rapid diversification of drug candidates. Several pharmaceutical companies invested in dedicated photochemistry capabilities for reaction discovery and scale-up.

**Industrial Adoption**: Flow photochemistry systems became commercially available from multiple vendors (Vapourtec, Corning, Chemtrix), enabling wider adoption beyond academic settings. The technology proved particularly valuable for generating diverse compound libraries in drug discovery programs.

**Scientific Developments**: Research in this area led to new photocatalytic systems, dual catalysis approaches combining photoredox with other catalytic cycles, and applications in natural product synthesis and materials science.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The article suggested that photochemistry contained "vast unexplored swaths of territory" and anticipated "more weird things" would emerge from such high-throughput discovery approaches.
• **Outcome**: This prediction proved accurate. The subsequent decade saw explosive growth in photoredox catalysis, with thousands of new photochemical transformations published. High-throughput screening approaches became standard practice, leading to discovery of numerous unexpected reaction pathways and enabling previously impossible chemical transformations.

• **Prediction**: Implicitly suggested that continuous-flow photochemistry would enable broader exploration of reaction space.
• **Outcome**: Flow photochemistry became a transformative technology, with widespread adoption across pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries, enabling scalable and safer photochemical processes.

• **Prediction**: Anticipated that the major challenge would be "figuring out what the heck happened" when unexpected products formed.
• **Outcome**: Advances in analytical techniques (particularly high-resolution mass spectrometry and automated structure elucidation) partially addressed this challenge, though reaction mechanism elucidation remains a significant focus of ongoing research.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

The article identified an important emerging methodology that subsequently transformed synthetic chemistry practice, though its scope is narrower than biotechnology industry-wide developments. Photoredox catalysis did become a foundational tool in drug discovery and chemical synthesis.
