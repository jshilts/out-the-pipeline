# Alex Tabarrok on Me-Too Drugs (December 2004)

## 1. SUMMARY
This Marginal Revolution blog post by Alex Tabarrok addresses "me-too drugs" in the pharmaceutical industry. These are drugs that are structurally similar to existing medications, often with slight modifications. According to the economic perspective presented, me-too drugs serve an important competitive function in the pharmaceutical market. When multiple manufacturers produce similar drugs, price competition emerges that benefits consumers. The post challenges the common criticism that these drugs represent wasteful duplication of research efforts. Instead, Tabarrok argues that the development of multiple similar drugs provides valuable redundancy, gives doctors and patients more treatment options, and creates pricing pressure that makes medications more accessible than if only one or two similar offerings existed.

## 2. HISTORY
In the two decades since this article was published, the me-too drug phenomenon has continued to be a significant feature of pharmaceutical development, particularly in highly lucrative therapeutic areas such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, and oncology. The economics of the pharmaceutical market have largely validated Tabarrok's analysis. Society benefits from having multiple drugs within the same class, and multiple options often provide meaningful clinical differences between patients and different clinical circumstances.

Me-too drugs have continued to demonstrate tangible benefits for patients and healthcare systems. For example, the introduction of multiple PCSK9 inhibitors for cholesterol management provides options when patients don't respond well to one specific medication or experience different side effect profiles. Similarly, the availability of multiple TNF-alpha inhibitors for autoimmune diseases gives physicians flexibility in matching treatment to individual patient needs. Ezetimibe remains on the market and is used in many patients, including combination therapy with statins. The pricing dynamics described by Tabarrok have indeed played out in practice.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article predicted that me-too drugs would continue to benefit society through competition and increased treatment options, a view that has been validated by subsequent experience. Health systems and patients have gained from having multiple medications within therapeutic classes, with different drugs showing varying effectiveness and side effect profiles across different patient populations. The PCSK9 inhibitor class provides a case example where the availability of multiple medications in the same class provides competition that can benefit systems and patients. The fundamental economic logic presented by Tabarrok—that multiple similar drugs create market competition benefiting consumers—has proven consistent with actual pharmaceutical market behavior over the past two decades. Rather than representing wasteful duplication, the availability of multiple drugs within therapeutic classes has generally enhanced patient care and system efficiency.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**
This article addresses an important and enduring issue in pharmaceutical economics and healthcare policy. While not highly technical or scientific, it provides valuable economic insight into a frequently misunderstood aspect of drug development. The topic remains relevant today as healthcare systems continue to grapple with drug pricing, access, and innovation policy decisions.
