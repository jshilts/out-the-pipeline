# What Industry Would Like to Hear About (March 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses a paper from Phil Baran's group highlighting productive collaborations between academic and industrial organic chemistry researchers, using examples like ingenol synthesis and partnerships with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer, Eisai, and Sigma-Aldrich. The author notes that while such collaborations are valuable, they remain relatively rare due to poorly structured, open-ended agreements that lack focus and motivation. The article proposes creating a public list of specific unsolved problems that would attract industry interest, making it easier for academics to target relevant research.

As a starting point for this list, the author suggests that late-stage oxidation and fluorination chemistries would generate strong industrial interest, particularly methods that could transform final drug-like compounds into new derivatives efficiently. This represents an area where reliable, practical methods would have immediate applications in drug discovery and development.

## 2. HISTORY
After this 2015 article, C-H functionalization—particularly late-stage oxidation and fluorination—continued to be an active and critical area of research in medicinal chemistry. Phil Baran's laboratory and other leading academic groups made significant advances, developing more reliable and selective methods for direct functionalization.

Major developments included improved late-stage fluorination methods allowing direct introduction of fluorine into complex molecules. This capability proved valuable for pharmaceutical development, as fluorine incorporation can enhance metabolic stability, binding affinity, and other drug properties. The Baran group and others refined C-H functionalization techniques to work on increasingly complex molecular architectures relevant to drug discovery.

The challenges identified in the article regarding academic-industry collaboration led to more structured partnerships, with pharmaceutical companies establishing clearer frameworks for collaborative research. Some companies published "wish lists" of desired synthetic methods, partially addressing the article's suggestion for better communication between sectors. Research consortia involving multiple companies and academic groups also became more common.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
* **The author's main prediction was that late-stage oxidation and fluorination chemistries would attract significant industrial interest and would be worth pursuing.**

* **This prediction proved accurate:** The period following 2015 saw substantial advances in late-stage functionalization methods, particularly selective C-H fluorination and oxidation reactions applicable to complex drug-like molecules.

* **The broader prediction that more targeted, specific academic-industry collaborations would be beneficial also gained support:** Pharmaceutical companies increasingly sought specific synthetic methodologies rather than broad exploratory partnerships, validating the article's emphasis on focused problem-solving.

* **The suggestion that public lists of unsolved problems would be useful influenced subsequent practices:** Various pharmaceutical companies and research organizations began publishing priority areas and unmet needs in medicinal chemistry, improving communication between academic researchers and industrial end-users.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
This article identified a real challenge in academic-industry collaboration and proposed practical solutions that resonated with the field. The specific focus on late-stage functionalization correctly anticipated a critical need in medicinal chemistry, though it represented one example of many areas where better communication and targeted research would be valuable.
