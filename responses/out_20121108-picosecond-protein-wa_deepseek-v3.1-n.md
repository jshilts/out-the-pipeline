# Picosecond Protein Watching (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article describes a breakthrough in time-resolved X-ray crystallography published in PNAS, where researchers achieved picosecond-level imaging of protein conformational changes using photoactive yellow protein (PYP) from purple sulfur bacteria as a model system. PYP contains a p-coumaric acid chromophore that undergoes trans-to-cis isomerization when hit by blue light, triggering signal transduction. The technique used multiple X-ray wavelengths scanned across protein crystals with precisely timed pulses relative to the light pulse, requiring world-class equipment and extensive repetition from multiple angles.

The analysis revealed a complex cascade of conformational changes: initial formation of a twisted cis structure with an out-of-plane carbonyl making transient hydrogen bonds, followed by relaxation to planar geometry, breaking of additional hydrogen bonds, and progression through multiple intermediate states. Approximately half the transitions failed at a critical bottleneck involving four hydrogen bonds and a 180-degree dihedral rotation. The authors expressed hope that this methodology could be extended to study enzyme mechanisms in real-time, providing unprecedented views of protein structure-dynamics-function relationships.

## 2. HISTORY
Time-resolved crystallography has indeed advanced significantly since 2012, though practical applications have been more methodical than revolutionary. The European XFEL (X-ray Free Electron Laser) became operational in 2017, and the LCLS-II upgrade at SLAC delivered first light in 2023, both providing femtosecond X-ray pulses that exceed the picosecond capabilities described in the 2012 paper. These facilities enabled serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) experiments that can capture molecular movies of proteins in action.

However, the technique has not become "routine" as one might have hoped. High costs (beamtime at these facilities exceeds $50,000 per day), technical complexity, and the requirement for specialized expertise have limited widespread adoption. While published studies have grown from perhaps a dozen time-resolved protein structures annually in 2012 to over 100 annually by 2023, most research groups still rely on static crystal structures.

Regarding "making our own enzymes to do things that Nature never dreamed of," the field of de novo enzyme design has advanced, with notable examples like the computationally designed enzymes for Kemp elimination and Diels-Alder reactions. However, most engineered enzymes still underperform natural enzymes in catalytic efficiency. Commercial applications remain limited outside specialized areas like enzyme-based detergents or industrial biocatalysis.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
- **Prediction: Time-resolved methodology "in principle, applicable to any other crystallizable protein whose function can be directly or indirectly triggered with a pulse of light"**
  - Reality: This has proven technically true but practically limited. While extensible in principle, few proteins naturally respond to light pulses, and designing photoswitchable variants has remained challenging. The technique has been successfully applied to perhaps 20-30 different proteins by 2023, mostly photosynthetic systems and light-sensitive receptors.

- **Prediction: "May prove possible to extend this capability to the study of enzymes, and literally watch an enzyme as it functions in real time"**
  - Reality: This has been achieved for several enzymes using clever triggering mechanisms (photosensitive caged substrates, temperature jumps, or chemical triggers combined with rapid mixing). However, "literally watch" remains somewhat metaphorical - reconstructing full reaction pathways from time-resolved data still requires significant modeling and computational fitting.

- **Prediction: Providing "unprecedented view into the relations between protein structure, dynamics, and function" to help validate theoretical approaches**
  - Reality: Time-resolved crystallography has indeed provided crucial data for validating and refining molecular dynamics simulations, quantum mechanical calculations, and enzyme mechanism proposals. However, the gap between experimental observables and computational models remains substantial due to resolution limits and the inherent complexity of protein dynamics.

## 4. INTEREST
**6/10** - This represents solid but not exceptional long-term importance. The technique has advanced meaningfully but fallen short of transforming routine structural biology, with practical impact limited to specialized research communities rather than broad clinical or industrial applications.
