# Microwave Synthesis (October 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article is a brief blog post announcement from October 16, 2013, introducing a new blog called "Totally Microwave" (http://totallymicrowave.wordpress.com/) that was created to cover developments in microwave-assisted chemistry. The author discloses a personal connection - the blog is run by a former colleague - and notes that they weren't aware of other sites specifically covering this area. The article serves primarily as a promotional recommendation, suggesting the new blog could be "a good addition to the list" for readers interested in microwave chemistry developments, and encourages people to "have a look."

## 2. HISTORY

Microwave-assisted chemistry is a well-established technique in organic synthesis and drug discovery that uses microwave irradiation to accelerate chemical reactions, often reducing reaction times from hours to minutes while improving yields. The technique became widely adopted in pharmaceutical and academic research settings starting in the 1990s and continued to expand through the 2000s and 2010s.

Regarding the "Totally Microwave" blog specifically, WordPress blogs that are no longer actively maintained often become unavailable over time. Without access to search the specific URL, I cannot confidently state the blog's current status or whether it achieved sustained readership or influence in the microwave chemistry community.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction about the blog**: The article implicitly suggests the blog would be valuable and fill a gap in coverage of microwave chemistry developments. The phrase "could be a good addition to the list" indicates an expectation that the blog would continue operating and provide useful content.
• **Outcome**: Unknown. Without the ability to verify the current status of http://totallymicrowave.wordpress.com/, I cannot assess whether the blog maintained regular posting, gained readership, or fulfilled the author's expectations.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **1/10**

This is essentially a promotional blog announcement rather than substantive commentary about biotechnology or microwave chemistry developments, offering no analytical content or broader industry insights.
