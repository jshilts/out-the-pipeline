# A Cure for the Common Cold? Don't. . .Ah, Hold Your Breath (February 2009)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article critiques media coverage of a 2009 rhinovirus genome sequencing study published in Science, which had sparked headlines about a potential cold cure. The author—a drug discovery chemist—argues that treating viral infections with small-molecule drugs remains exceptionally difficult, pointing out that there are virtually no truly curative antiviral drugs. The study had sequenced 99 different rhinovirus strains and grouped them into at least 15 distinct classes, revealing substantial genetic diversity and frequent recombination between strains. This high mutation rate makes a single universal vaccine unlikely. The author contrasts sober scientific interpretation with overoptimistic quotes from one co-author who mentioned finding an "Achilles' heel" for treatment, while other scientists acknowledged that viral diversity and recombination make vaccines "impossible."

## 2. HISTORY
Despite the 2009 sequencing breakthrough, no curative drug for the common cold reached market approval in the subsequent decade. The fundamental challenges identified in 2009—extreme genetic diversity and rapid viral evolution—proved accurate. The rhinovirus field did not see the development of broad-spectrum antivirals in routine clinical use.

Preventive vaccine development faced the exact hurdles described: with nearly 170+ human rhinovirus serotypes requiring either polyvalent or broad cross-neutralizing approaches, no successful vaccine emerged. Early vaccine trials in the 1960s had already shown limited cross-protection, and post-2009 research confirmed that achieving universal coverage across the group remains impractical due to antigenic diversity.

Meanwhile, COVID-19 demonstrated that effective coronavirus vaccines could be developed rapidly with mRNA platforms, but these target the stable spike proteins of a single virus family, conditions that don't apply to rhinoviruses. The immune evasion mechanisms of rhinoviruses continue to frustrate vaccine design, even as technology advanced.

One modest glimmer appeared with pleconaril—an antiviral that showed some activity against rhinoviruses in early 2000s trials but never gained FDA approval due partly to drug interactions and emergence of resistant strains. Pleconaril was later studied in immunocompromised patients but remains experimental. The broader antiviral approach of targeting conserved viral proteins like 3C protease or host-targeting strategies (e.g., targeting viral receptor ICAM-1) has shown limited clinical or commercial success.

The focus for common cold interventions shifted towards supportive care (symptom relief) and public health measures (hand hygiene, masking), while serious efforts in virology R&D prioritized viruses with higher morbidity and clearer paths to therapeutic success (like HIV, hepatitis C, and influenza antivirals).

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction: "Developing fifteen different simultaneous vaccines" deemed impractical**
  - **Outcome**: This proved accurate. No universal vaccine emerged post-2009. High-tech vaccine platforms like mRNA have succeeded against individual pathogens (e.g., COVID-19, RSV) but have not overcome rhinovirus's extreme serotype diversity, as predicted. The "scurrying, hopping, moving target" characterization was prescient.

• **Prediction: Hype around immediate "cures" would disappoint people**
  - **Outcome**: Accurate. The overoptimistic framing ("Achilles' heel" for treatment) did not translate into real-world therapies. No curative drug for the common cold exists today, and there remains significant public confusion between colds (caused by rhinoviruses and other viruses) and preventable illnesses like influenza.

• **Prediction: Small-molecule drug approaches would face difficulty with viral targets**
  - **Outcome**: Generally true for rhinoviruses specifically, though modern virology now has effective broad-spectrum antivirals for other targets (e.g., protease inhibitors for hepatitis C, neuraminidase inhibitors and polymerase inhibitors for influenza, and remdesivir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for SARS-CoV-2). The particular constraints of rhinovirus biology—especially the large antigenic diversity and host-immune escape—limited translatability into a broadly effective oral therapy compared to other viral families.

## 4. INTEREST
**Rating: 7/10**

This article usefully punctured media overhype and correctly anticipated the key scientific barriers that would persist—high viral diversity and absence of a clear druggable Achilles' heel constrained therapeutic development. It demonstrated solid scientific skepticism but was arguably too dismissive of translational possibilities that did eventually materialize for other viral diseases.
