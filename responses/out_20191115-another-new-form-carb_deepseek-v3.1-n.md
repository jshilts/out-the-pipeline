# Another New Form of Carbon - It's A Weird One (November 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article describes the serendipitous discovery of a novel carbon allotrope by Joel Therrien of UMass-Lowell in November 2017. While attempting to synthesize "pentagraphene" (a theoretically predicted carbon structure composed solely of five-membered rings) using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with 2,2-dimethylbutane as a precursor, Therrien unexpectedly produced a silver-polished material on copper foil at 800°C.

The material exhibits remarkable and unusual properties for carbon: it is harder than stainless steel yet lighter, electrically conductive, reflects more than 90% of light (even in 50 nm layers), and displays ferromagnetism that persists at elevated temperatures. Structural characterization suggests the material contains both six- and twelve-membered carbon rings forming wavy layers with bridging bonds between layers, featuring a mix of sp² and sp³ hybridization. Films can be produced microns thick across centimeter scales, and annealing above 1100°C transforms it into a more homogeneous semiconductor form. The article expresses excitement about potential applications such as durable reflective coatings for telescope mirrors and industrial uses, pending further research to fully characterize the structure using techniques like electron diffraction crystallography.

## 2. HISTORY

**Scientific Investigation and Characterization:**

The material described in the 2019 article has since been identified as a form of carbon nanotube-based or graphite-like carbon material, though the precise structure and reproducibility of the specific ferromagnetic, highly reflective carbon allotrope claimed by Therrien has not been conclusively established in peer-reviewed literature.

**Publication and Research Trajectory:**

The Science article referenced in the blog post (Science, 366(6467):782) reported on Therrien and colleagues' work on a novel carbon allotrope with metallic properties, presented at conferences in 2019. However, subsequent detailed characterization studies of this specific material structure have not appeared in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals at the scale one would expect for a genuinely new carbon allotrope with such extraordinary properties.

**Ferromagnetic Carbon Research Context:**

Carbon materials with intrinsic ferromagnetism have been reported sporadically in the literature, with various mechanisms proposed including defect-induced magnetism, edge states in graphene structures, or the presence of transition metal impurities. However, room-temperature ferromagnetism in pure carbon materials remains a subject of active debate. No carbon allotrope with robust, technologically useful ferromagnetism has been conclusively demonstrated and commercialized since this report.

**Reflective Coating Applications:**

The article's suggestion of using this material for telescope mirrors has not materialized. Telescope mirrors continue to use aluminum-based coatings, occasionally with enhanced protective layers. Research has focused instead on optimizing aluminum or silver coatings for astronomical applications, with techniques like atomic layer deposition improving durability.

**Industrial Development:**

No commercial products based on Therrien's discovery have reached the market. CVD-based carbon materials research has continued, with graphene and carbon nanotubes receiving significantly more research investment and commercial attention. The synthesis method using branched hydrocarbon precursors like 2,2-dimethylbutane has not become a standard approach for carbon material production.

**Scientific Community Response:**

The research community has maintained healthy skepticism about reports of novel carbon allotropes with unusual properties. Reproducibility and thorough structural characterization using multiple techniques remain essential requirements. Claims of extraordinary new materials require extraordinary evidence, including detailed crystal structure determination, extensive property measurements, and independent replication by multiple research groups.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**• Prediction: The material's remarkable properties would make it "a very useful industrial substance, depending on how it can be produced and worked."**
**Outcome:** Not realized. No industrial applications or commercial products have emerged from this discovery. The material did not achieve the widespread utility anticipated, and production scaling has not been demonstrated.

**• Prediction: "I would expect to see quite a bit of work following up on this in the nanoscale community, and I look forward to seeing where it goes!"**
**Outcome:** Limited. While some related research has continued on carbon materials with unusual properties, the specific carbon allotrope described by Therrien has not generated sustained, extensive follow-up research or led to significant new research directions in the broader nanoscience community.

**• Prediction: Electron diffraction crystallography would help solve the structure and the discoverers would pursue this approach.**
**Outcome:** Uncertain. No comprehensive structural determination has been published that conclusively resolves the atomic arrangement of the material. The lack of detailed structural information in subsequent high-profile publications suggests this structural characterization may have proven more challenging than anticipated.

**• Prediction: The magnetic properties "still present even at elevated temperatures" would sound "very useful."**
**Outcome:** Not validated. No practical magnetic applications have been developed from carbon materials with the reported ferromagnetic properties. The temperature stability and practical utility remain unproven.

**• Prediction: The >90% light reflection for telescope mirrors as a coating "that doesn't degrade in air" would be valuable.**
**Outcome:** Not implemented. Telescope mirrors continue to use traditional aluminum-based coatings with occasional silver enhancements. No carbon-based reflective coatings have been adopted for astronomical applications.

**• Prediction: Annealing above 1100°C producing a more homogeneous semiconductor form would lead to "formation of larger crystalline domains."**
**Outcome:** No evidence. No semiconductor devices or applications based on this annealed material have been reported, and the crystalline domain sizes have not been extensively characterized or optimized for electronic applications.

**• Prediction: This would become an important addition to the family of carbon allotropes alongside graphene, fullerenes, etc.**
**Outcome:** Not achieved. The material has not been widely accepted as a major new carbon allotrope or integrated into the standard understanding of carbon allotropes in textbooks and review articles, partly due to incomplete structural characterization and limited reproducibility.

**• Prediction: The discovery would enable commercial production of the material since the precursor (2,2-dimethylbutane) is "available by the ton."**
**Outcome:** Never demonstrated at commercial scale. Despite the availability of cheap precursors, no evidence suggests successful scaling of the synthesis method or economic viability.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 4/10**

The article describes what appeared to be an exciting scientific discovery with unusual and potentially useful properties, but the lack of subsequent validation, reproducibility issues, and failure to translate into practical applications reduces its long-term significance. The potential applications discussed remain speculative and unrealized.
