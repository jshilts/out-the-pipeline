# The 3D Fragment Consortium (August 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses a UK-based initiative called the 3D Fragment Consortium addressing a persistent problem in fragment-based drug discovery: the overrepresentation of flat, aromatic chemical structures in screening libraries. Conventional fragment collections heavily favored planar aromatic compounds, limiting exploration of three-dimensional chemical space that might offer better drug-like properties and target engagement. The consortium found that over 90% of commercially available fragments were too flat and concluded that bespoke synthesis—rather than purchasing existing compounds—was necessary to build libraries with better 3D character. They advocated incorporating natural-product-like structures, diversity-oriented synthesis approaches, and other non-flat chemistries to expand biologically relevant chemical space for more effective drug discovery starting points.

## 2. HISTORY

Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) has since become a well-established approach in pharmaceutical research, though not without challenges. Several drugs discovered through FBDD have reached the market: **Vemurafenib** (Zelboraf) for melanoma, **Venetoclax** (Venclexta) for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and **Erdafitinib** (Balversa) for bladder cancer. These successes validated the FBDD approach, though it's worth noting that most approved FBDD-derived drugs still predominantly address kinase targets—limiting generalizability across target classes.

The push for more 3D fragments led to academic and commercial efforts to develop "fragment-to-lead" libraries with improved shape diversity. Companies like **Zenobia Therapeutics**, **Astex Pharmaceuticals**, and **Vernalis** increased focus on fragment libraries with better 3D character. Academic groups developed new synthetic methodologies (C–H activation, cascade reactions, photochemistry, biocatalysis) to access these shapes.

However, the promise of "3D fragments" has seen mixed adoption. While the conceptual shift occurred, the practical screening infrastructure and commercial supply still heavily emphasize traditional aromatic frameworks. Many campaigns still start from flat aromatic hits due to easier synthetic accessibility and more predictable binding modes.

The 3D fragment concept influenced the broader field, contributing to discussions about molecular complexity, escape from "flatland," and privileged scaffolds in medicinal chemistry.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

* **"Bespoke synthesis will be necessary" rather than buying commercial fragments** - **Mostly accurate**: Academic and pharmaceutical groups did develop custom 3D fragment libraries through synthesis, though commercial vendors (e.g., Enamine, Life Chemicals, Key Organics) also gradually expanded offerings with more 3D-enriched collections.
* **"Novel molecules will expand biologically relevant chemical space" and provide better drug discovery starting points** - **Partly accurate**: While newer libraries diversified available chemical space, many drug discovery campaigns still start from relatively flat fragments; 3D character alone didn't guarantee better outcomes. Success remained target-dependent.
* **"Academic synthetic chemistry will play a significant role" in facilitating this expansion** - **Accurate**: Academic groups developed enabling synthetic methodologies (C–H functionalization, photoredox catalysis, enzymatic functionalization) that facilitated access to saturated, sp3-rich frameworks.
* **"Future publications from the group will show results"** - **Partially fulfilled**: The 3D Fragment Consortium and similar initiatives did publish work on fragment library design and screening statistics, but comprehensive success metrics for 3D fragments versus conventional fragments remained limited.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

The article addresses a foundational challenge in drug discovery—chemical library design—with lasting impact. It anticipated an important shift in medicinal chemistry toward more 3D molecular architectures, though practical adoption proved more complex than hoped, with commercial uptake still lagging theoretical benefits.
