# Is Carl Icahn Going Away? (August 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary noted that recent SEC filings showed activist investor Carl Icahn had completely sold his stake in Biogen and no longer held positions in Amgen or Regeneron. The author recalled a previous discussion of Icahn’s “biotech adventure” and suggested that his exit might indicate a lack of attractive opportunities in the sector. The piece was essentially a brief observation rather than an in‑depth analysis, asking readers to wonder whether Icahn’s departure signaled a broader shift in biotech investing.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Biotech market after 2011** – The sector continued to expand dramatically. From 2012‑2024, several blockbuster biologics and gene‑therapy products entered the market, driving double‑digit revenue growth for many large biotech firms.

- **Biogen**: After Icahn’s exit, Biogen acquired Human Genome Sciences (2012) and secured FDA approval for **Benlysta** (lupus, 2011) and later **Spinraza** (nusinersen for spinal muscular atrophy, 2016) and **Ocrevus** (ocrelizumab for multiple sclerosis, 2017). Ocrevus became Biogen’s top‑selling drug, generating > $5 billion annually by 2023. The company’s market cap grew from ~ $30 billion in 2011 to > $70 billion in 2023.

- **Regeneron**: Already benefiting from **Eylea** (approved 2011), Regeneron launched **Dupixent** (dupilumab) in 2017 for atopic dermatitis and later for asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis. Dupixent’s sales surpassed $5 billion in 2022, making Regeneron one of the most valuable independent biotech firms (market cap ≈ $80 billion in 2023).

- **Amgen**: Continued to expand its portfolio with **Repatha** (PCSK9 inhibitor, 2015) and **Otezla** (apremilast, 2014). Amgen’s revenue grew steadily, reaching > $30 billion in 2023, and the company remained a top‑10 biotech by market cap.

**Icahn’s biotech involvement post‑2011** –  
- **Minimal activist activity**: Icahn did not launch any high‑profile activist campaigns in biotech after 2011. His public focus shifted to sectors such as energy (e.g., Chesapeake Energy), consumer goods (e.g., Apple, eBay), and financial services.  
- **Occasional passive stakes**: SEC filings show Icahn Enterprises held small, non‑controlling positions in a few biotech‑related firms (e.g., a modest stake in **Alnylam Pharmaceuticals** in 2015‑2016, which was later sold). These were portfolio investments rather than activist pushes.  
- **No major spin‑offs or board battles**: Unlike his earlier involvement with Biogen, Icahn did not force restructurings, spin‑offs, or board changes in any biotech company after 2011.

**Broader activist trends** – While Icahn stepped back, other activist investors entered biotech. Notable examples include:

- **Bill Ackman’s Valeant (later Bausch Health)** – aggressive price‑raising strategy (2015‑2016).  
- **Nelson Peltz’s stake in **Regeneron** (2020) – pushed for strategic acquisitions.  
- **Third‑party activist funds** (e.g., Pershing Square, Third Point) have targeted biotech firms for governance changes, especially around pipeline valuation and cash burn.

Overall, the biotech sector proved resilient and even thrived, contradicting any implication that the space had become unattractive to investors.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not list explicit forecasts, but it implied two expectations:

- **Prediction 1:** *Icahn’s exit suggested a dearth of compelling biotech opportunities.*  
  - **Outcome:** False. While Icahn personally withdrew, the sector attracted substantial capital, multiple blockbuster approvals, and continued activist interest from other investors.  

- **Prediction 2 (implicit):** *The biotech industry might see reduced activist pressure.*  
  - **Outcome:** Partially true for Icahn specifically, but false in the broader sense. Activist activity persisted and even grew, with several high‑profile campaigns after 2011.

No specific drug or company performance predictions were made in the piece, so no direct comparison is possible.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10**  
The article is of moderate historical interest: it captures a moment when a well‑known activist stepped back from biotech, offering a snapshot of investor sentiment at the time. However, its brevity, lack of analysis, and limited predictive content keep it from being a seminal piece on biotech strategy.
