# GlaxoSmithKline Reviews the Troops (September 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reports on GSK’s 2008‑2011 re‑organisation of its R&D into 38 small, disease‑focused “Drug Performance Units” (DPUs). Each DPU is given a three‑year budget and must re‑justify its funding at the end of the cycle. The piece notes that the overhaul was painful – morale was low and many scientists feared cuts – but senior executives (notably CEO Andrew Witty) claimed the new structure had made the R&D organisation “healthier” and more productive. The author questions whether three‑year windows are long enough to judge scientific quality, warns that the system could encourage “telling management what they want to hear,” and wonders how many cycles GSK will actually run.

## 2. HISTORY  
**What happened after the first three‑year review (2014‑2015)**  

| Year | Key development | Outcome / impact |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| **2014** | GSK announced a second R&D transformation, moving from the DPU model to larger “R&D units” aligned to therapeutic areas and to a “pipeline‑centric” funding process. | The DPU structure was effectively retired; funding decisions became more centralized and longer‑term (five‑year plans). |
| **2015** | Sale of GSK’s oncology portfolio to Novartis for US$16 billion. | Reduced the size of the pipeline and allowed GSK to focus on vaccines, specialty medicines, and consumer health. |
| **2015‑2017** | Significant headcount reductions (≈2,500 R&D jobs) and closure of several UK sites. | R&D spend fell from ~£13 bn (2011) to ~£10 bn; the company shifted toward external collaborations and open‑innovation models. |
| **2017** | FDA approval of **Shingrix** (herpes zoster vaccine). | First major product from the post‑reorg pipeline; strong commercial uptake (≈$4 bn sales by 2022). |
| **2018** | Launch of **Biktarvy** (co‑developed with ViiV Healthcare) for HIV. | Became one of GSK’s best‑selling drugs, confirming the focus on specialty medicines. |
| **2020** | Spin‑off of the consumer‑health business (now **Haleon**). | Freed additional cash for R&D; GSK’s “core” now consists of vaccines, specialty pharma, and a smaller consumer portfolio. |
| **2021** | FDA approval of **Jemperli** (dostarlimab, PD‑1 inhibitor) for endometrial cancer. | First checkpoint inhibitor from GSK’s renewed oncology effort (later partnered with **Novartis** after the 2015 sale). |
| **2022‑2023** | Progress on RSV vaccine (candidate **RSVpreF**) and other late‑stage assets; continued modest NME approvals (e.g., **Nucala** for eosinophilic asthma, 2022). | Demonstrates that the post‑DPU pipeline is delivering products, though at a slower rate than the pre‑2008 era. |
| **2024** | GSK announced a new “R&D 2025” strategy emphasizing **vaccines, specialty medicines, and digital‑enabled R&D**; further cuts to “non‑core” projects. | The company now measures success by **pipeline quality metrics** (e.g., probability of technical success) rather than simple project counts. |

**Overall assessment** – The three‑year DPU cycle was short‑lived; by the second cycle GSK had abandoned the model in favour of larger therapeutic‑area units and a longer planning horizon. The restructuring did not instantly lift productivity, but it coincided with a strategic pivot that eventually produced several high‑impact products (Shingrix, Biktarvy, Jemperli) and a more focused pipeline. The anticipated “healthy” R&D organisation materialised in the sense of a leaner, more externally collaborative operation, but the original DPU concept itself was not retained.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself makes no explicit numeric forecasts, but it contains implicit expectations:

- **Expectation:** *DPUs will improve R&D performance and justify their budgets every three years.*  
  **Reality:** The DPU model was discontinued after the first cycle; performance improvements were later pursued through different structures. The three‑year review cadence proved too short for scientific validation.

- **Expectation:** *The new structure will either keep projects on track or cause “telling management what they want to hear.”*  
  **Reality:** Post‑2014 reforms introduced more rigorous portfolio‑level metrics (technical success probability, milestone‑based funding). While internal pressure to present favorable data remains a generic risk, GSK’s later public disclosures show a greater emphasis on objective go/no‑go criteria.

- **Expectation (implied):** *If the system works, GSK’s pipeline will become more productive and generate new drugs.*  
  **Reality:** After a lull (2012‑2015) GSK secured three FDA approvals (Shingrix, Biktarvy, Jemperli) and several EU approvals between 2017‑2023. The volume of NMEs is modest, but the commercial impact of the approved products has been significant, especially for vaccines and HIV therapy.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The article is a useful snapshot of a major R&D experiment at a top‑tier pharma company, but the specific DPU framework was short‑lived, limiting its long‑term relevance. Its value lies in illustrating how large firms attempt structural change and the challenges of measuring early‑stage productivity.
