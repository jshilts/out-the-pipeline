# Big News in Cancer, Versus Big Talk About It (January 2020)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary contrasts two parallel narratives in cancer medicine circa early 2020. On one hand, real progress: the American Cancer Society reported the largest recorded drop in U.S. cancer death rates for 2016–2017 (2.2%), driven by immunotherapy and targeted agents for lung and skin cancer—tangible gains that built on a longer decline since the early 1990s (~1.5% per year). On the other, hype: the author revisits Patrick Soon-Shiong's "Cancer Moonshot 2020," a high-profile effort launched in 2016 that promised transformative breakthroughs but by 2020 had gone quiet—its website dark, social accounts inactive, and no visible research output. The piece also references earlier grand pronouncements, including an FDA commissioner's 2003 claim about eliminating cancer death by 2015 and the UK prime minister's 2013 talk of an Alzheimer's cure by 2025, arguing that substantive work consistently outpaces press-conference boosterism.

## 2. HISTORY

**American Cancer Society report and ongoing trends (2016–2017 and beyond):**
- The 2.2% drop in 2016–2017 was real and noteworthy. Subsequent ACS annual reports (2018–2024) continued to show year-over-year declines in overall U.S. cancer mortality, though not always matching the 2.2% rate. Immunotherapy (anti–PD-1/PD-L1, anti–CTLA-4) and targeted therapies (EGFR, ALK, BRAF/MEK inhibitors, among others) became standard of care in multiple solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Lung cancer mortality has continued to decline in large part due to earlier detection, reduced smoking, and better systemic therapies in both non–small cell and small-cell settings. Real-world uptake has been substantial, although access, cost, and toxicity remain significant challenges.

- In parallel, incidence trends have shifted. Lung cancer incidence continued a long-term decline tied to reduced smoking, but certain cancers (e.g., colorectal in younger adults, HPV-related oropharyngeal, some obesity-related cancers) have shown concerning increases, partly offsetting some mortality gains. Screening advances (e.g., low-dose CT for lung cancer in high-risk individuals) also contributed to stage shift and improved outcomes.

**Patrick Soon-Shiong and "Cancer Moonshot 2020":**
- By 2020, the initiative had effectively faded from public view. Press scrutiny at the time found minimal clinical trial outputs, a defunct website, and inactive social media. No major drug approvals or pivotal trials stemming directly from the initiative materialized by 2020 or in the years immediately after. Soon-Shiong continued involvement in healthcare and media (e.g., ownership of the Los Angeles Times, investments in healthcare entities), but "Cancer Moonshot 2020" did not produce the promised near-term clinical breakthroughs.

- The lesson underscored by this example is consistent with broader evidence: large, hyped initiatives often yield disappointing results when they prioritize publicity over rigorous execution. In contrast, incremental, peer-reviewed, and clinically validated advances—such as the immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted kinase inhibitors already in practice at the time—proved to be what actually drove the mortality reductions observed by the ACS.

**Broader context of ambitious timelines:**
- The FDA commissioner's 2003 remarks about eliminating cancer death by 2015 proved clearly overstated; cancer remained a leading cause of death, though mortality did decline over that period. Similarly, the UK's 2013 hope for an Alzheimer's cure by 2025 did not materialize; major late-stage Alzheimer trials continued to show high failure rates through the 2010s. Aducanumab (approved controversially in 2021) and lecanemab (approved in 2023) offered only modest cognitive effects in early-stage disease and sparked ongoing debates about clinical meaningfulness and access. Neither fulfilled the "cure by 2025" ambition.

**Indirect impact on policy and research culture:**
- The contrast between hype and substance has arguably made funders, clinicians, and the public more cautious about promotional announcements lacking peer-reviewed data. The Biden Cancer Moonshot (relaunched in 2022) has emphasized coordination, data sharing, and early detection, with a more measured tone than earlier initiatives, and has seen gradual progress (e.g., ARPA-H projects, enhanced screening initiatives) rather than singular "breakthrough" claims. It is too early to assess its long-term clinical impact, but its framing reflects lessons learned from prior hype cycles.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Implicit and explicit predictions in the article:**

- **Prediction (implicit): Real-world immunotherapies and targeted agents will continue to drive mortality declines, while initiatives based on "big talk" without rigorous execution will fail.** **Outcome:** Largely correct. Cancer mortality continued to fall after 2017/2018, and immunotherapy/targeted therapy became even more central to oncology practice. The "Cancer Moonshot 2020" produced no discernible clinical advances. The general principle—that substantive work beats promotional hype—has held up across multiple therapeutic areas and policy initiatives.
  
- **Prediction (explicit question): "How much of that drop in the cancer death rate is due to Patrick Soon-Shiong?"** **Outcome:** Nearly zero direct contribution in the 2016–2020 window. No major trial readouts, guidance changes, or drug approvals attributable to his initiative appeared. The mortality drop was driven by existing immunotherapies and targeted agents from established research and industry pipelines.
  
- **"Clapping your hands and wishing for great results doesn't get you very far—use your hands instead to put on a lab coat..."**: **Outcome:** Supported by subsequent evidence. Continued mortality declines arose from concrete advances (more indications for checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cell therapies, refined targeted therapies, and better supportive care), not from high-profile announcements lacking data.
  
- **The 2016–2017 2.2% drop as a "bow shock" of new therapies**: **Outcome:** Partially supported. Immunotherapy expanded into additional lines and tumor types after 2017 (e.g., adjuvant NSCLC, HCC, RCC, MSI-high tumors), contributing to sustained declines. However, some gains also reflected longer-term trends (smoking reduction, earlier diagnosis). The 2.2% was higher than the prior baseline but did not reset to zero afterward; declines continued, suggesting a durable wave of impact rather than a one-time spike.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/10**

The article captured a durable tension between overpromotion and genuine progress in medicine, using timely examples and solid data. Its core message remains relevant to interpreting biotech communications today.
