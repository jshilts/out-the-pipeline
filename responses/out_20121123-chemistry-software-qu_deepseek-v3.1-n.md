# Chemistry Software Questions Answered Monday (November 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief post from Science's blog announces that Philip Skinner, a Perkin-Elmer employee supporting chemical software products, would be available the following Monday to answer user questions about the company's chemistry software suite. The products mentioned include ChemDraw, ChemDraw4Excel, E-Notebook, Inventory, Registration, Spotfire, and Chem3D. The format was structured as a Q&A session where Skinner would respond to technical and usage questions in the comment thread of an upcoming post.

## 2. HISTORY
Following this 2012 announcement, the chemistry software landscape continued to evolve. PerkinElmer's ChemDraw remains one of the most widely used chemical structure drawing tools in academia and industry, maintaining its market position through subsequent versions and updates. The broader chemistry software market saw significant consolidation and transition to cloud-based platforms between 2012-2024. PerkinElmer continued expanding their informatics portfolio, though some product lines were later divested or restructured. The Q&A format for software support became increasingly common across platforms, with many companies adopting real-time chat, community forums, and scheduled expert sessions. ChemDraw's dominance in chemical structure representation persisted, but faced increasing competition from open-source alternatives and integrated platforms like ChemAxon and various SaaS offerings.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made no specific predictions about future developments in chemistry software or industry trends.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 2**

This was a routine support announcement with very limited broader significance beyond immediate user assistance needs. While ChemDraw is important software, this particular post had minimal long-term impact or general interest.
