# What's Translational Synthesis, Anyway? (April 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article critiques a Nature Chemical Biology paper on "Translational Synthetic Chemistry," arguing that giving this approach a formal name risks turning it into a buzzword for what may not be a distinct field. The author notes that H3 Biomedicine (a Broad Institute offshoot) promotes Diversity-Oriented Synthesis (DOS), which attempts broad exploration of chemical space through systematic library generation, alongside natural product scaffold-based approaches. While acknowledging the call for new compound libraries and high-throughput screens, the author expresses skepticism about pure DOS as effectively "random" exploration of an incomprehensibly vast chemical space.

The article advocates instead for biased approaches that increase hit rates in drug discovery, particularly favoring natural-product-like molecules that have evolutionary track records. Specific techniques include using natural products as starting materials for libraries (as in Paul Hergenrother's work) and generating fragment collections beyond conventional ones. The piece positions DOS, fragment-based drug discovery, and natural products not as "either/or" competing paradigms but as potentially complementary strategies, while questioning whether the sheer volume of random screening—without evolutionary guidance—is sufficient or efficient.

## 2. HISTORY

The core tension described—between broad diversity screening and targeted natural-product-inspired design—continued to play out over the following decade, though in nuanced ways:

- DOS and library-focused approaches did not revolutionize drug discovery as some initially hoped. Few approved drugs trace to purely synthetic DOS libraries, and challenges remained around library quality, purity, systematic bias, and difficulty navigating "chemical space" comprehensively. The cost and logistics of large-scale synthesis limited adoption relative to expectations from the early 2010s.

- Natural product scaffolds and semi-synthetic modification remained productive in drug development, but difficulties with complex synthesis, supply, and IP hampered widespread adoption of platform-based natural product libraries in discovery pipelines. That said, natural products still dominate approved small-molecule drug origins, with continued relevance in antibiotics, oncology, and immunology.

- Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) matured and saw broader adoption, with more sophisticated fragment-to-lead optimization methodologies and several drugs eventually approved that originated as fragment hits. Unlike DOS-style mass library generation, FBDD emphasized careful biophysical screening of small, high-quality fragment sets followed by iterative optimization—a more focused approach.

- DNA-Encoded Library (DEL) technology grew in the late 2010s, enabling exploration of much larger library sizes in a cost-effective fashion. While still screening-based, DEL platforms tend to be heavily designed with careful bias toward drug-like and natural-product-inspired building blocks.

- H3 Biomedicine was acquired by Eisai in 2015, continuing antibody discovery and cancer projects but without establishing "translational synthetic chemistry" as an industry-standard term. The company neither failed nor broke fundamentally new ground in purely synthesis-driven discovery.

- The emergence of AI/ML-based virtual screening and generative chemistry (mid-2010s onward) shifted the focus toward computationally-guided design rather than random or semi-random screening of massive physical libraries. This undercut some DOS arguments by suggesting that "coverage" of chemical space could be achieved with smaller, smarter sets and predictive modeling.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions through its arguments and endorsement:

- **Natural-product-like libraries would have higher hit rates than pure synthetic DOS**  
  → Mixed results. Natural product uses remained significant, but most successful modern drugs derive from a mix of sources—incremental medicinal chemistry on known scaffolds, fragment/NCE hybrids, and targeted biologics. No clear dominance of natural-product-inspired libraries in generating breakthrough approvals.

- **Pure DOS would struggle due to the vastness of chemical space and low hit rates from random exploration**  
  → Largely correct. DOS did not become the dominant discovery paradigm, with limited applications and relatively few compounds of broad importance advancing. Challenges with library quality, screening relevance, and cost-benefit led to reduced enthusiasm by the late 2010s.

- **Fragment-based drug discovery would be viable but not sufficient alone**  
  → Confirmed. FBDD became an important complementary tool—successful in multiple approved drugs—but it did not displace other approaches. It was integrated into broader discovery workflows, not a standalone solution.

- **"Translational Synthetic Chemistry" as a term would gain little traction**  
  → Correct. The term did not become standard in academic departments, industry roles, or major papers; it remained a niche phrasing.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

While the article explored timely debates about drug discovery strategy circa 2013, its long-term importance is modest. The specific paradigms under discussion (DOS, natural-product libraries) did not experience transformative breakthroughs or failures that fundamentally reshaped drug discovery; their trajectories became more nuanced rather than landmark validations or refutations. The discussion was sensible but not prescient about larger shifts (e.g., applications of AI in chemistry, DEL platforms, biologics dominance) that would matter more in the subsequent decade. A historically informative, but not pivotal, commentary.
