# Amylin on the Block (Mar 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The brief commentary notes that Amylin Pharmaceuticals reportedly rejected a “multi‑billion‑dollar” acquisition offer from Bristol‑Myers Squibb (BMS).  It asks rhetorically who might purchase Amylin if not BMS, and points readers to a FiercePharma roundup for further speculation.  No detailed analysis of Amylin’s pipeline or financials is provided; the piece is essentially a news‑type “who‑will‑buy‑next?” blurb.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Acquisition by BMS (2012‑2013)** – Contrary to the article’s claim that Amylin turned down BMS, Bristol‑Myers Squibb announced in March 2012 that it would acquire Amylin for **≈ $5.5 billion** (cash + stock).  The deal closed in July 2012, making Amylin a BMS subsidiary.  The acquisition gave BMS a portfolio that included the GLP‑1 agonist **exenatide (Byetta)** and the amylin analogue **pramlintide (Symlin)**, as well as a pipeline of diabetes‑focused candidates.

**Product milestones** – After the acquisition, BMS launched the extended‑release formulation **Bydureon** (exenatide once‑weekly) in 2012, expanding the GLP‑1 market.  However, BMS’s diabetes franchise struggled to gain market share against competitors (e.g., Novo Nordisk’s liraglutide, Eli Lilly’s dulaglutide).  Several late‑stage Amylin programs were discontinued or deprioritized.

**Divestiture to Eli Lilly (2017)** – In October 2017, BMS sold its entire diabetes portfolio—including Amylin’s assets, the Byetta/Bydureon franchise, and related pipeline candidates—to Eli Lilly for **≈ $2.3 billion**.  The transaction reflected BMS’s strategic shift away from diabetes and the modest commercial performance of the acquired products.

**Current status (2024‑2026)** – The former Amylin assets now sit within Eli Lilly’s diabetes business.  Byetta remains on the market but occupies a niche, while Bydureon has been largely eclipsed by newer weekly GLP‑1 agents (e.g., semaglutide).  No major Amylin‑originated drug has become a market leader in the past decade.  The Amylin brand itself has been retired; its scientific contributions are now subsumed under the parent companies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article did not articulate explicit forecasts beyond “who will buy them.”  The implicit expectation was that a large pharma would eventually acquire Amylin, but that BMS had already been rejected.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *Amylin would be bought by a major pharmaceutical company other than BMS.*  
  **Outcome:** *BMS ultimately **did** acquire Amylin (for $5.5 B) in 2012, directly contradicting the article’s premise.*

- **Prediction (implicit):** *A “multi‑billion‑dollar” deal was on the table, suggesting high valuation.*  
  **Outcome:** *The final deal price (~$5.5 B) matched the “multi‑billion” description, confirming the valuation estimate.*

No other specific forecasts (e.g., product approvals, market share) were made, so no further comparison is possible.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 5/10** – The piece is a short, speculative news note with limited analytical depth; its primary interest lies in the hindsight that the reported rejection was inaccurate, illustrating how quickly acquisition dynamics can change.
