# Short Chemistry Topics (September 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This blog post highlights four notable chemistry developments from 2017. First, a breakthrough synthetic route using rhodium catalysts to efficiently produce cis-fluorinated saturated rings from fluoroaromatic starting materials, solving a previously challenging preparation problem for specialty fluorinated solvents. Second, development of "supersequence" NMR experiments combining multiple 1D and 2D techniques into single runs with significant time savings. Third, the opening of Europe's XFEL free-electron laser facility capable of 27,000 frames per second for time-resolved X-ray crystallography. Fourth, improved Janus filter membranes with differential surface functionalization for better oil/water separation, particularly addressing emulsions with non-ionic surfactants.

## 2. HISTORY

**Fluorinated Cyclohexanes**: The Glorius group's 2017 Science paper on rhodium-catalyzed hydrogenation of fluoroaromatics provided practical access to valuable fluorinated building blocks. In subsequent years, such selectively fluorinated molecules found applications in medicinal chemistry (improving metabolic stability), materials science (specialty polymers), and as performance solvents. The methodology influenced continued catalyst development for selective fluorination chemistry.

**NMR Supersequences**: The 2017 supersequence approach gained traction in analytical laboratories seeking higher throughput. Major NMR manufacturers (Bruker, JEOL) incorporated related pulse sequence packages, and the concept influenced development of faster multidimensional NMR methods, particularly valuable in pharmaceutical analysis and natural product characterization where sample throughput matters.

**European XFEL**: Since opening in 2017, the European XFEL has enabled breakthrough structural biology, including studies of protein dynamics, enzyme mechanisms, and damage-free imaging of biological samples. The facility facilitated innovations like serial femtosecond crystallography and contributed to understanding of coronavirus spike proteins during the COVID-19 pandemic. The LCLS-II upgrade mentioned in the article reached first light in 2023 with MHz repetition rates.

**Janus Membranes**: The dual-functionalized membrane technology for oil/water separation addressed a genuine industrial need. Subsequent R&D expanded to environmental remediation applications, produced water treatment in oil/gas operations, and industrial wastewater processing. Commercial products emerged, though widespread adoption faced challenges around membrane fouling, durability, and cost scaling.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **"I would enjoy knowing if there's a similar route that might work on fluoropyridines or fluoropyrroles"** - This inquiry anticipated broader applicability of selective hydrogenation methodology. Subsequent research did extend such catalytic hydrogenation approaches to heterocyclic systems, though with varying success depending on substrate electronic properties.

• **"The LCLS is planning an upgrade that would take it up to millions of pulses per second"** - This accurately anticipated LCLS-II development, which achieved first light with MHz repetition rates, enabling unprecedented time-resolved structural studies.

• **Implicit prediction about supersequences being applied broadly** - Adopted primarily in specialized analytical labs rather than routine use, though benefits were real where instrument time efficiency mattered.

## 4. INTEREST 

**Rating: 3/10**

A collection of competent but incremental chemistry news items with limited long-term transformative impact. While the topics were scientifically sound, the post lacks the broader significance that would warrant higher ranking, though the XFEL development had lasting importance for structural biology.
