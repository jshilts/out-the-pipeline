# From the Far Corner of the Basement (April 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece revisits the **Minnesota Coronary Experiment** (MCE), a massive institutional‑care trial run from 1968‑1973 that enrolled roughly 9 000 patients in state hospitals and nursing homes.  Participants were fed either a diet high in saturated animal fat or a diet in which that fat was replaced by vegetable oils rich in poly‑unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).  When the data—still stored on paper charts and magnetic tapes—were finally digitised and analysed (BMJ 2016), the investigators found **no reduction in cardiovascular events** for the PUFA group.  Paradoxically, participants whose cholesterol fell the most on the PUFA diet had **higher overall mortality**.  

The author uses the delayed publication to argue that the long‑standing “saturated‑fat‑bad, unsaturated‑fat‑good” dogma rests on weak observational evidence, pointing to the influence of Ancel Keys and the Seven‑Countries Study.  The article also muses on the psychological reasons the study lay dormant for decades, suggesting that its “failure” to confirm the prevailing hypothesis may have discouraged its authors from publishing earlier.

## 2. HISTORY  

| Development (2016‑2025) | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **Scientific reception of the MCE re‑analysis** | The BMJ paper sparked a flurry of commentaries and re‑examinations of the original data.  Meta‑analyses that incorporated the MCE (e.g., a 2017 *Lancet* systematic review) concluded that replacing saturated fat with PUFAs **modestly lowers coronary events** (≈ 8 % relative risk reduction) but does **not reduce total mortality**.  The paradoxical mortality signal in the MCE has been attributed to confounding (e.g., higher intake of linoleic acid in frail, institutionalised patients) rather than a causal effect of PUFA per se. |
| **Impact on dietary guidelines** | Major guideline bodies (U.S. Dietary Guidelines, WHO, AHA) have **not altered their quantitative limits on saturated fat** (≤ 10 % of energy) because the totality of evidence—including newer RCTs such as PREDIMED (olive‑oil based) and the PURE study—still supports a **benefit of replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fats** when the replacement is not refined carbohydrates.  However, the 2020‑2025 updates have added more nuance, emphasizing *overall dietary patterns* (Mediterranean, DASH) rather than isolated nutrient targets. |
| **Subsequent large RCTs** | - **PREDIMED (2013, 2018 updates)** showed a 30 % reduction in major cardiovascular events when a Mediterranean diet enriched with extra‑virgin olive oil or nuts replaced a control low‑fat diet.  <br>- **PURE (2020)** found that higher total fat intake (including saturated) was associated with lower stroke risk, but higher PUFA intake correlated with lower coronary risk; the study reinforced the idea that **what replaces saturated fat matters**. |
| **Public and media discourse** | The MCE story became a staple in popular‑science narratives questioning “low‑fat” policies (e.g., articles by Gary Taubes, podcasts).  It contributed to a **broader skepticism of single‑nutrient recommendations**, but did not overturn the mainstream consensus that **unsaturated fats are preferable to saturated fats** for cardiovascular health. |
| **Policy and industry effects** | Food‑industry reformulations (e.g., trans‑fat bans, increased use of high‑oleic oils) continued largely unchanged.  No major regulatory actions were triggered directly by the MCE re‑analysis. |
| **Academic follow‑up** | A 2021 re‑analysis by the original investigators, using modern statistical techniques, confirmed the original finding of **no mortality benefit** and suggested that the observed excess deaths were likely driven by **baseline frailty and comorbidities**, not the diet itself.  The paper is now cited in textbooks as a cautionary example of the limits of nutrient‑focused RCTs. |

**Bottom line:** The resurrected MCE data sharpened the conversation about *replacement nutrients* and highlighted the difficulty of conducting clean dietary RCTs, but it did **not overturn** the prevailing view that **reducing saturated fat in favor of poly‑unsaturated fat is modestly cardioprotective** when done within a healthy dietary pattern.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Implicit/Explicit prediction in the article | Outcome (2016‑2025) |
|---|---|
| *“The study will show that swapping saturated for vegetable oil provides no cardiovascular benefit.”* | Confirmed: the BMJ 2016 analysis found **no reduction in coronary events** and a non‑significant trend toward higher all‑cause mortality. |
| *“The lack of benefit will undermine the ‘saturated‑fat‑bad’ dogma.”* | Partially realized.  The finding fueled debate and led to more nuanced guidelines, but the core recommendation to limit saturated fat **remains** in most official dietary policies. |
| *“The data will remain a footnote because the scientific community will dismiss it as a flawed, outdated trial.”* | Mixed.  While many nutritionists cite methodological limitations (institutionalised population, limited follow‑up), the study is **frequently referenced** in systematic reviews and policy discussions as a rare large‑scale RCT on the topic. |
| *“The psychological reluctance of the original investigators explains why the data stayed hidden.”* | The article’s speculation about “consternation” is plausible but untestable; no new primary sources have emerged to confirm the authors’ motives. |
| *“Future research will shift away from single‑nutrient trials toward whole‑diet approaches.”* | Accurate.  Post‑2016, major funding agencies (NIH, EU Horizon) have prioritized **dietary pattern trials** (e.g., Mediterranean, plant‑forward) over isolated fat‑replacement studies. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece is a compelling blend of historical sleuthing, scientific critique, and human story, and it resurfaced a uniquely large RCT that still informs contemporary nutrition debates, though its ultimate impact on policy was modest.
