# Medicinal Chemistry Books (November 2016)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article is a curated bibliography of contemporary medicinal chemistry and drug discovery literature, compiled as a yearly roundup for practitioners. Organized thematically, it lists over 40 titles spanning histories and overviews (e.g., *The Evolution of Drug Discovery*, *Blockbuster Drugs*), general medicinal chemistry textbooks (e.g., Krogsgaard-Larsen et al., Silverman 3rd ed.), and specialized topics such as lead generation, fragment-based drug discovery, ADME/toxicity (e.g., Kerns and Di), toxicology, pharmacology, biostatistics, and chemoinformatics. The author notes reader recommendations and edition updates, aiming to bridge knowledge gaps between academia and industry and provide practical references across the drug discovery pipeline, from preclinical research to chemical development and formulation.

## 2. HISTORY

This 2016 list reflects a pre-hype, tools-and-textbook moment in drug discovery—just before several later shifts altered both the science and the conversation.
- **Target class evolution**: Many of the listed topics (fragment-based discovery, protein–protein interactions, allosterism) remained active research areas. Fragment-based methods became more routine screening tools at pharma and biotech companies (e.g., Astex, Vernalis models persisted), and PPI modulators advanced into clinical trials (e.g., venetoclax, approved 2016, leveraged SBDD; navitoclax/ABT-263 in oncology). Allosteric kinase inhibitors have become a standard design strategy in oncology (e.g., asciminib for CML, approved 2021).
- **Modality expansion**: The list’s focus is overwhelmingly small-molecule focused. The years after 2016 saw continued growth of biologics (monoclonal antibodies, bispecifics, ADCs), cell and gene therapies (CAR-T, Luxturna 2017, Zolgensma 2019), and RNA therapeutics (first siRNA drug patisiran approved in 2018; mRNA COVID-19 vaccines 2020–2021). These developments rebalanced industry pipelines and, in some therapeutic areas, reduced the dominance of traditional small-molecule medicinal chemistry. Immuno-oncology altered target priorities (PD-1/PD-L1 targeting dominated cancer research and approvals), often favoring biologics over small molecules for immune checkpoints.
- **Methods and data science**: In silico and computational chemistry titles noted in 2016 were soon superseded by rapid advances in structure-based drug design, AI/ML-driven approaches (e.g., AlphaFold2 in 2021, generative models), and large-scale virtual screening. Chemoinformatics merged more deeply with machine learning and big data pipelines.
- **ADME/PK and translational science**: The emphasis on ADME/DMPK remained central to reducing attrition. Real-world patient PK/PD data and modeling (e.g., PBPK) became routine, and permeability/gut stability considerations influenced earlier discovery decisions. BBB penetration strategies remained critical for CNS programs, with mixed success across industry.
- **Clinical impact and attrition**: The period post-2016 saw many high-profile approvals (e.g., ibrutinib expansion, osimertinib in EGFR+ NSCLC, numerous IO agents) but also major clinical failures (e.g., Alzheimer’s programs like aducanumab and many BACE inhibitors). Success rates remained modest (about 10% from Phase I to approval for oncology, lower for CNS), reinforcing the need for better target validation and translational models.
- **Process/development chemistry**: Continuous manufacturing, flow chemistry, and green chemistry gained adoption in process development, while regulatory harmonization (ICH) continued shaping pharmaceutical development practices.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No explicit predictions appear in this article. It is a curated bibliography, and its value proposition is practical guidance on existing texts rather than forecasting.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This list was a pragmatic, timely resource for medicinal chemists in 2016, but it now serves mainly as a historical snapshot of the field’s bibliography rather than a landmark analysis of scientific or policy shifts.
