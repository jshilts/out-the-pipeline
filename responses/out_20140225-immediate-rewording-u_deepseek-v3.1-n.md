# For Immediate Rewording. Uh, Release. (February 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 commentary criticized business journalists for uncritically repeating Pfizer's press release language about palbociclib (a CDK inhibitor) directly into their reporting. The article highlighted how The Wall Street Journal and Associated Press had lifted phrases like "potential to transform the standard of care" for post-menopausal women with ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer straight from Pfizer's press release without independent verification or seeing actual clinical trial data. The author argued that this highlighted the gap between business reporters and medical reporters, with the latter being more skeptical about company claims without presented evidence. The piece noted that Pfizer was likely pushing for accelerated approval after recent pipeline setbacks (dacomitinib failure) and facing competition from Novartis in the same therapeutic space. The core argument was that journalists should contextualize such announcements rather than simply rewording corporate press releases.

## 2. HISTORY

Palbociclib (Ibrance) went on to achieve significant success following this 2014 commentary:

**Regulatory Approval**: The drug received FDA accelerated approval in February 2015 based on the PALOMA-1 trial results, followed by full approval in 2017. It was the first CDK4/6 inhibitor approved for breast cancer treatment.

**Clinical Impact**: Palbociclib demonstrated substantial real-world efficacy and became a standard component of care for HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer, typically combined with hormonetherapy. Clinical studies showed significant improvement in progression-free survival.

**Market Adoption**: The drug achieved blockbuster status, generating over $5 billion in annual sales by 2019-2020. It saw widespread adoption among oncologists and became a first-line treatment option for the indicated patient population.

**Competitive Landscape**: Novartis's rival CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib (Kisqali) was approved in 2017, followed by Eli Lilly's abemaciclib (Verzenio) the same year, creating a three-drug competitive market in this space.

**Subsequent Developments**: Pfizer gained additional approvals for palbociclib in early breast cancer and male breast cancer. The drug maintained strong market position despite competition, though it faced some safety concerns regarding rare but serious side effects.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The original article made several implicit and explicit predictions:

- **That Pfizer was pushing for accelerated approval**: ✓ **Correct** - Palbociclib received accelerated approval in February 2015, just about a year after this article.

- **That the drug needed actual clinical data before meaningful assessment**: ✓ **Correct** - The PALOMA-1 data ultimately supported the approval, though the accelerated pathway meant longer-term outcomes were still being evaluated at approval time.

- **That journalists should wait for presented, reviewed data rather than company spin**: ✓ **Validated** - The subsequent peer-reviewed publication of trial results provided the substantive evidence base that the article argued was necessary.

- **That competition with Novartis was significant**: ✓ **Correct** - The CDK4/6 inhibitor market became highly competitive with multiple players, though Pfizer maintained first-mover advantage and market leadership.

- **That dacomitinib's failure created pipeline pressure**: ✓ **Plausible** - While we cannot assess internal Pfizer motivations, the subsequent aggressive push for palbociclib approval was consistent with this prediction.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This article captures an important but routine moment in pharmaceutical journalism - the tension between corporate communications and independent reporting. While the specific drug involved became important, the phenomenon described (press release recycling) is unfortunately common rather than extraordinary.
