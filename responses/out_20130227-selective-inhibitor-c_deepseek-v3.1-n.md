# Selective Inhibitor, The Catalog Says (February 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This blog post raises serious concerns about a chemical compound being sold by Millipore as a selective inhibitor of two specific enzymes. The author calls attention to its molecular structure - a double nitrophenyl Schiff base enone with an acrylamide group - which contains multiple red flags characteristic of PAINS (Pan-Assay Interference Compounds). These are compounds that tend to give false positive results in drug screening assays because they react non-specifically with multiple biological targets rather than through selective binding. The author expresses extreme skepticism that such a reactive structure could truly be selective, suggesting it would likely bind to many more proteins than just the claimed two targets.

## 2. HISTORY
The concerns raised in this 2013 article reflect a broader and highly impactful movement in drug discovery that continued to gain momentum in subsequent years. The PAINS concept, first systematically described by Baell and colleagues in 2010, became increasingly recognized as a critical quality control issue in early drug discovery. Academic researchers and pharmaceutical companies began implementing computational filters and experimental protocols to identify and eliminate PAINS from screening libraries and published results. The critique exemplified by this blog post contributed to improved awareness among researchers, though the problem persisted in the literature for years afterward. This issue did not lead to specific FDA-approved drugs or policy changes, but it fundamentally changed best practices in drug discovery screening and helped reduce wasted research effort on false positives. The underlying scientific principle - that reactive compounds often show promiscuous rather than selective binding - became standard knowledge in medicinal chemistry.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Implicit prediction that the compound binds to many proteins beyond the claimed two targets**: This aligns with the established PAINS concept - such reactive structures do indeed tend to be promiscuous binders, though comprehensive proteome-wide profiling would be needed for definitive confirmation.
• **Implicit prediction that selling such compounds as "selective inhibitors" was problematic**: The drug discovery field moved toward greater scrutiny of compound quality, with vendors becoming more careful about characterization and researchers more skeptical of commercial claims.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**
This article represents an important but niche topic - while PAINS awareness became crucial in drug discovery, the impact was primarily within specialized scientific circles rather than broader public or clinical significance.
