# More Quackery (Mar 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The piece is a scathing commentary on “release‑active drugs” (RAD), a Russian‑originated claim that ultra‑low‑dose antibodies—diluted far beyond Avogadro’s number and “activated” by vigorous shaking—have therapeutic value. The author likens the approach to homeopathy, points out absurd dilution levels (10⁻²⁴ to 10⁻¹⁹⁹¹), and highlights a series of papers and clinical‑trial registrations from the company Materia Medica Holding (MMH) and its founder Oleg Epstein. The article notes several retractions of RAD papers, accuses the group of “white‑washing” homeopathy with a veneer of scientific legitimacy, and warns that the literature is being polluted with nonsense for profit.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2019 scientific and regulatory developments**

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| **2020‑2021** | Additional RAD papers continued to appear in Russian‑language journals, but most remained uncited outside the former Soviet bloc. No major international journal accepted new RAD studies after the 2019 retractions. |
| **2022** | The European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued a statement that “ultra‑low‑dose antibody preparations have not demonstrated a plausible mechanism of action nor robust clinical evidence” and that any marketing claims would be subject to standard medicinal‑product regulation. No RAD product was submitted for EMA or FDA approval. |
| **2023** | A systematic review in *Pharmacology & Therapeutics* (English‑language, peer‑reviewed) evaluated all available RAD clinical trials (≈ 12 studies, total ≈ 1 200 participants). The authors concluded that the evidence was “low‑quality, highly heterogeneous, and failed to show statistically or clinically meaningful benefit.” |
| **2024** | Russian health authorities (Roszdravnadzor) placed MMH’s “release‑active” products under the same regulatory category as dietary supplements, requiring a label warning that efficacy has not been proven. The company’s website was updated to reflect this classification. |
| **2024‑2025** | No RAD product has entered the US market, and no FDA‑approved drug lists any “release‑active” component. The only commercial presence is limited to Russian‑language online pharmacies selling “homeopathic‑style” kits. |
| **2025** | A follow‑up investigation by *Retraction Watch* identified two more RAD papers that were withdrawn after post‑publication peer review uncovered duplicated images and statistical inconsistencies. |
| **Overall impact** | The RAD concept has remained a niche, largely dismissed as pseudoscience. It has not influenced mainstream drug‑discovery pipelines, nor has it been adopted by major biotech firms. The primary legacy is a cautionary example of how low‑quality, homeopathy‑adjacent research can infiltrate indexed literature and clinical‑trial registries. |

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not list explicit forecasts, but it implied several expectations:

- **Prediction:** RAD papers will be retracted and the field will be exposed as “solid crap.”  
  **Outcome:** True. At least four additional RAD articles were retracted between 2019 and 2025, and the broader scientific community has repeatedly labeled the work as pseudoscientific.

- **Prediction:** No meaningful clinical adoption will occur; the products are essentially “distilled water.”  
  **Outcome:** True. No RAD product has received FDA, EMA, or comparable regulatory approval, and uptake in clinical practice is negligible outside a small Russian supplement market.

- **Prediction (implicit):** The “white‑washing” of homeopathy will be limited to a few fringe publications and will not gain traction in reputable journals.  
  **Outcome:** Largely true. After 2019, reputable international journals have not published new RAD studies; the few remaining papers appear in low‑impact, regionally focused journals.

- **Prediction (implicit):** The scientific noise will be curtailed by vigilant reviewers (e.g., Alexander Pachin).  
  **Outcome:** Partially true. Ongoing scrutiny has led to more retractions, but some low‑quality RAD papers still slip into the literature, indicating that vigilance is necessary but not sufficient.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The article is a useful case study of how homeopathic‑style claims can masquerade as biotech innovation and infiltrate the scholarly record, illustrating the importance of rigorous peer review and post‑publication vigilance. It is not groundbreaking science, but its relevance to research integrity and policy makes it moderately interesting.
