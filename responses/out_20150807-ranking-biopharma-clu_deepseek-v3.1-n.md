# Ranking the Biopharma Clusters (August 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article critiques a 2015 consulting report by JLL that ranked the top biotech clusters in the United States. The author expresses skepticism about the rankings, particularly questioning why Research Triangle (North Carolina) was placed at number two ahead of the San Francisco Bay Area. The author notes that Boston/Cambridge's top position is uncontroversial, but finds the Research Triangle ranking difficult to believe despite personal connections to the area. Other rankings included SF Bay Area at #3, San Diego at #4, followed by New York, LA, and Philadelphia. The author also references ongoing downsizing at GSK and wonders whether this corporate restructuring would ultimately spawn new biotech companies in the region.

## 2. HISTORY
The skepticism expressed in the 2015 article appears to have been largely validated by subsequent developments. Over the subsequent 7-8 years, the Boston/Cambridge biotech hub continued to dominate, with Kendall Square alone housing hundreds of biotech companies and maintaining its position as arguably the world's leading biopharma cluster. The SF Bay Area also maintained and strengthened its position as a definitive top-tier cluster alongside Boston, with both regions capturing the vast majority of biotech venture capital funding and major pharmaceutical company presence.

Research Triangle, while remaining an important biotech center, did not achieve the #2 position that the 2015 JLL report suggested relative to the Bay Area. The area continued to host significant research infrastructure (including major universities and NIH funding) and several large pharmaceutical companies, but did not reach the venture capital concentration, startup density, or commercial pipeline momentum seen in either Boston or the Bay Area.

What actually happened was more of a "Big Two" consolidation at the top - Boston and the Bay Area - with research showing these two regions consistently capturing 40-50% of all U.S. biotech venture funding and major pharmaceutical company presence. San Diego also maintained its position as the clear #3 hub (though distant from the top two), with strengths particularly in devices, diagnostics, and some therapeutic areas. GSK's downsizing did contribute some entrepreneurial activity, but not at a scale that fundamentally shifted the Research Triangle's overall cluster ranking.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Research Triangle's #2 ranking**: The JLL report predicted/presented Research Triangle as the second-largest biotech cluster. **This did not materialize** - Boston and the Bay Area remained clearly ahead, with most subsequent analyses placing Research Triangle in the mid-tier of clusters rather than near the top.

• **GSK downsizing spawning new companies**: The author wondered whether GSK's "ferocious downsizing" would create new startup companies. **This partially occurred** - there was some entrepreneurial activity from former GSK employees, but not at a scale that fundamentally transformed the regional ecosystem or shifted national rankings.

• **Implicit prediction that rankings would remain stable**: The author's tone suggested that major hub positions were already well-established. **This proved largely accurate** - the dominant positions of Boston and the Bay Area were reinforced rather than challenged in subsequent years.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**

The article addresses a standard industry topic (cluster rankings) with limited long-term importance, mainly serving as a snapshot of mid-2010s thinking about regional biotech strength.
