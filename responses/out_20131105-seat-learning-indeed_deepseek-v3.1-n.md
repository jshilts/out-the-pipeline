# The Seat of Learning, Indeed (November 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses a satirical protest by academic writer Rebecca Schuman against the excessive documentation requirements for faculty job applications. Frustrated that search committees demand "bushels of stuff" that they likely don't read, Schuman offered $100 to the first two people who submitted proof that they had included a scan of their butt among their supporting materials for a legitimate academic job application, with herself as the sole judge of what constituted an actual butt scan. The "Buttscan" idea quickly gained traction online, with at least one winner already announced. The author relates this to their own fantasy of offering money to anyone who actually read their lengthy semi-annual lab reports, highlighting the widespread frustration with bureaucratic requirements in academia that may be more about demonstrating compliance than genuine review.

## 2. HISTORY
In the years following this 2013 article, the issues it highlighted only intensified. Academic hiring became even more competitive, with positions routinely receiving hundreds of applications. The adjunct crisis worsened, with non-tenure-track positions now comprising approximately 75% of faculty in US higher education. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated pre-existing trends, leading to hiring freezes, program cuts, and increased reliance on contingent labor. 

Schuman herself continued writing about academic issues, publishing pieces in outlets like Slate and The Chronicle of Higher Education, often criticizing academic bureaucracy and unrealistic job expectations. The broader conversation she participated in evolved into discussions about "quit lit" - academics publicly announcing their departure from the field due to systemic problems. The academic labor market continued its decline, with fewer tenure-track positions and more PhD graduates than available jobs, making the competitive application processes even more Kafkaesque. However, no major reforms to hiring practices emerged from this specific protest movement - the bureaucratic requirements largely remained, though some institutions did begin experimenting with streamlined application processes and blind review techniques.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article makes no explicit predictions about the future. It is primarily commentary on a contemporary situation rather than an attempt to forecast how academic hiring or the "Buttscan" phenomenon might evolve. The tone is observational and satirical rather than predictive in nature.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 4/9**

This article captures an interesting moment of satirical resistance against academic bureaucracy, but it represents a niche commentary on hiring practices rather than a pivotal piece with broad long-term importance. While it resonated with many in academia, its impact was primarily cultural rather than resulting in systemic change.
