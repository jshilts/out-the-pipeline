# Effective CNS Drugs Are Where You Find Them (June 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses the stagnation in psychiatric drug development during the 21st century. The author argues that the most promising recent developments in psychopharmacology have come from drugs of abuse—specifically ketamine for depression and MDMA for PTSD—rather than through traditional pharmaceutical research pipelines. The argument suggests that the pharmaceutical industry's focus on developing drugs with minimal side effects (like SSRIs) has resulted in medications with barely perceptible therapeutic effects.

The article explores the hypothesis that because the brain's higher functions (consciousness, mood, reasoning) are poorly understood and highly interconnected, dramatic interventions that "smack the brain really hard" may be more effective than precisely targeted approaches. The author suggests that our crude understanding of neuroscience means unusual therapies deserve clinical investigation, even if they work through mechanisms we don't fully comprehend.

## 2. HISTORY

**Ketamine**: Esketamine (Spravato) received FDA approval for treatment-resistant depression in March 2019 and has been incorporated into clinical practice. It has shown real-world efficacy for patients who don't respond to conventional antidepressants, though uptake has been limited by cost, administration requirements (clinically supervised nasal spray), and the need for monitoring due to dissociative side effects. Ketamine clinics have proliferated offering off-label IV ketamine treatments. The mechanism remains incompletely understood but appears to involve glutamate pathway modulation rather than traditional monoamine pathways.

**MDMA**: The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) completed Phase 3 trials for MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD. The first Phase 3 trial (MAPP1) showed positive results in 2021, with 67% of participants no longer meeting PTSD criteria after treatment. The second Phase 3 trial results were more mixed, showing lower effect sizes. As of late 2024, MDMA-assisted therapy has not yet received FDA approval despite extensive clinical research, facing regulatory hurdles and questions about trial design and effect size durability.

**Psilocybin**: Research has progressed significantly with breakthrough therapy designations from the FDA for treatment-resistant depression and major depressive disorder. Compass Pathways completed Phase 2b trials for psilocybin therapy for treatment-resistant depression showing promising results. However, no psychedelic therapy has yet received full FDA approval as of 2024, though Oregon and Colorado have legalized supervised psilocybin services at the state level.

**Traditional pharma pipeline**: The CNS drug development landscape has remained challenging. Many major pharmaceutical companies reduced or exited neuroscience research in the late 2010s due to high failure rates and uncertain ROI. Approval rates for CNS drugs have continued to lag behind other therapeutic areas.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **MDMA would revolutionize PTSD treatment**: The article predicted MDMA would "come in like a bolt from the blue" when trial results emerged. *Outcome*: Results have been positive but more mixed than initially hoped, with regulatory approval still uncertain despite decades of research and favorable Phase 3 data.

• **Ketamine represented a breakthrough approach**: The article correctly identified ketamine's promise as a fundamentally different mechanism for depression. *Outcome*: FDA-approved and clinically utilized, though not as broadly transformative as initially hoped due to practical limitations (Route of administration, monitoring requirements, cost).

• **"Smacking the brain really hard" approach would prove fruitful**: The article predicted dramatic interventions would outperform subtle, targeted approaches. *Outcome*: Partially validated—ketamine and psychedelics do show efficacy for treatment-resistant populations, but they haven't displaced existing therapies as first-line treatments, and their mechanisms appear more nuanced than simple "brain smacking."

• **Rational drug design limitations in psychiatry**: The article predicted continued challenges in developing targeted psychiatric medications. *Outcome*: Validated—CNS drug development has remained difficult, with many companies exiting the field due to poor success rates and limited mechanistic understanding.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article successfully identified a genuine trend toward repurposing psychoactive compounds for psychiatric treatment and correctly anticipated the continued challenges of rational CNS drug design, making it prescient and substantively important to the field's trajectory.
