# Merck's CETP Inhibitor: Late-Stage Clinical Success Followed by Abandonment

## 1. SUMMARY

This June 2017 commentary discusses Merck's announcement that its CETP inhibitor anacetrapib met its primary endpoint in the REVEAL cardiovascular outcomes trial—the first positive result ever seen for this drug class after a decade of failures.

The article provides crucial context about CETP inhibitors, which had become "an expensive wasteland for drug development" since Pfizer's torcetrapib failed catastrophically in 2006. Every subsequent CETP inhibitor had failed in clinical trials, making Merck's positive announcement genuinely surprising.

The REVEAL trial was a massive cardiovascular outcomes study involving 30,000 patients with existing cardiovascular disease, all receiving statin therapy. The trial found that anacetrapib significantly reduced major coronary events compared to placebo. However, the author notes several cautionary points: Merck's unusually hesitant language about regulatory filing, questions about whether the benefit came from HDL-raising or LDL-lowering effects, concerns about the drug accumulating in adipose tissue, and whether the effect size would be clinically meaningful in an already crowded cardiovascular market.

## 2. HISTORY

Merck announced in **October 2017**—just four months after the initial positive announcement—that it was **discontinuing development of anacetrapib** entirely. The company stated that while REVEAL met its primary endpoint, the magnitude of clinical benefit was not sufficient to justify pursuing regulatory approval and commercialization.

The full REVEAL trial results, presented at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in August 2017, showed that anacetrapib reduced major coronary events by **9% relative risk reduction** over approximately 4 years of treatment. While statistically significant, this modest benefit was considered insufficient for a new cardiovascular drug that would add to patients' pill burden and costs.

Merck's decision to abandon the program despite a positive Phase III trial highlighted several key realities about drug development:
- **Effect size matters more than statistical significance**: A statistically significant but clinically modest benefit may not justify the investment required for regulatory approval and marketing
- **The CETP mechanism itself remained questionable**: Even with positive results, it was unclear whether the benefit came from CETP inhibition (HDL-raising) or from off-target LDL-lowering effects
- **Negative class effect**: Despite anacetrapib breaking the string of failures, the broader CETP target never recovered credibility in the pharmaceutical industry

No CETP inhibitor has been approved by the FDA or any other major regulatory agency as of today. The entire drug class remains clinically unused.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several predictions and cautious observations, most of which proved accurate:

• **"Merck might well be finding themselves in the position of King Pyrrhus"** - **CORRECT**. This was remarkably prescient. Merck did achieve a "Pyrrhic victory"—winning the clinical trial at enormous expense only to abandon the program as commercially unviable.

• **The effect size concern** - **CORRECT**. The article questioned "what the magnitude of these positive results might have been" and whether the trial was "nominally positive, but not positive enough." The eventual 9% risk reduction indeed proved insufficient.

• **That it was too early to declare CETP victory** - **CORRECT**. The author's closing line—"no one should count a CETP victory until every last bit of the news is in"—was validated when Merck dropped the program months later.

• **The broader CETP mechanism questions** - **VALIDATED**. Even with one positive trial, the fundamental doubts about whether CETP inhibition itself provided benefit remained unresolved, and the mechanism never gained clinical acceptance.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article provides a fascinating real-time window into one of pharmaceutical development's most important cautionary tales—achieving statistical success while facing commercial failure due to insufficient clinical meaningfulness. The CETP inhibitor story fundamentally shaped how the industry evaluates cardiovascular drug targets and outcome trial designs.
