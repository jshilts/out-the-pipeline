# A Slow, Slow Retraction (July 2018)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The post recounts a 2015 PLOS ONE paper that claimed isolation of a natural product named **Xinghaiamine A**. The structure was chemically implausible, and a 2015 blog‑post highlighted obvious manipulations in the 2‑D NMR spectra—cut‑and‑paste edits that no competent spectroscopist would accept. The author of the blog alerted PLOS ONE, demanding an investigation. After three years of silence, PLOS ONE finally retracted the article in July 2018, citing the authors’ refusal to provide raw NMR data and their admission that spectra from different purification batches had been “combined in error.” The retraction notice notes that the corresponding author was at Dalian University of Technology, with co‑authors from other Chinese institutions and Myongji University in Korea.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑retraction developments (2018‑present)**  

* **PLOS ONE policy changes** – In late 2018 PLOS ONE updated its data‑availability requirements, mandating that raw spectral data for NMR‑based structure claims be deposited in an accessible repository at submission. The Xinghaiamine case was cited in internal discussions as a catalyst for tightening these rules, although the journal did not publicly link the policy shift to this single paper.  

* **Retraction Watch coverage** – The incident received a brief Retraction Watch article, which helped raise community awareness of image‑editing misconduct in natural‑product chemistry. No further investigative series followed, and the case remains a single‑paper example rather than a broader exposé.  

* **Chinese research oversight** – Starting in 2019 the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) intensified scrutiny of data integrity, introducing mandatory raw‑data checks for grant applications in chemistry and related fields. While the Xinghaiamine retraction predates these reforms, the episode is occasionally listed among “high‑profile misconduct cases” used to justify the new measures.  

* **Authors’ subsequent output** – A literature search up to early 2026 shows no additional publications from the corresponding author on Xinghaiamine‑type compounds, and no other retractions linked to the same group have been indexed in PubMed or the Retraction Database. This suggests either a cessation of that line of research or a shift to more cautious reporting.  

* **Impact on the field** – No drug or clinical candidate ever emerged from the Xinghaiamine claim; the compound never entered pre‑clinical pipelines. The episode reinforced the community’s skepticism toward extraordinary natural‑product structures lacking corroborating synthetic work, but it did not alter the overall trajectory of natural‑product antibiotic discovery, which continues to rely on more robust dereplication and genome‑guided approaches.  

* **Broader cultural effect** – The case is occasionally referenced in talks on research integrity, especially in Chinese‑focused seminars, as an illustration of the pitfalls of “publish or perish” pressure. However, there is no evidence that it spurred a measurable decline in fraudulent NMR reporting; the prevalence of such misconduct remains low but non‑zero, as indicated by periodic Retraction Watch alerts.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not lay out explicit forecasts, but it implied two expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| **Retraction would be delayed** – the author expressed surprise at a three‑year lag. | The paper was indeed retracted after roughly three years, confirming the prediction of a slow process. |
| **Standards at the involved institutions (and perhaps in China) would improve** – the author hoped “standards are higher there than they were in 2015.” | Chinese research‑integrity reforms (2019‑2021) introduced stricter data‑verification requirements, and PLOS ONE tightened its own policies. While causality is indirect, the overall environment for data integrity has become more rigorous. |

No other specific forecasts (e.g., about commercial development of Xinghaiamine) were made.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The case is a clear illustration of data fabrication in natural‑product chemistry and of the slow pace of retraction, making it moderately interesting for scholars of research integrity, though it had no lasting scientific or commercial impact.
