# How Many Things Can Be Enzymes, Anyway? (December 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 article discusses the discovery that synthetic genetic polymers called XNAs (xeno-nucleic acids) can function as enzymes, catalyzing reactions like RNA cleavage and ligation. The piece begins by noting that while proteins were long considered the primary biological catalysts, the discovery of ribozymes showed that nucleic acids could also perform catalysis. New research demonstrated that completely artificial polymers with unnatural carbohydrate backbones (ANA, FANA, HNA, CeNA) could be selected from random pools to exhibit catalytic activity, including endonuclease and ligase functions.

The author frames this as significant for understanding life's fundamental requirements and evolutionary origins—suggesting life could have developed with different chemical backbones than RNA/DNA. The article also speculates on practical implications like industrial catalysts that could be more robust than proteins and considers astrobiological possibilities for extraterrestrial life built on alternative biochemistries. The author muses that if alien life shares biochemical similarities with Earth life, it might contain potent allergens.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2014 XNA catalytic work was part of an expanding field investigating alternative genetic polymers and nucleic acid enzymes. The foundational paper (Taylor et al., *Nature* 2014) established that XNAs could function as catalysts, and subsequent developments built on this:

**XNA Research and Applications (2015-2023):**
- XNA research expanded with additional polymer types and applications, but widespread commercial or therapeutic adoption has not materialized
- Modified nucleic acids gained traction primarily in diagnostic applications (e.g., molecular beacons, PCR optimization) rather than as industrial catalysts
- The most successful alternative nucleic acids have been established modifications like 2'-O-methyl, 2'-fluoro, and phosphorothioate linkages, primarily for antisense oligonucleotides and aptamers rather than enzymes

**Industrial Enzyme Catalysis:**
- Protein enzymes remain dominant in industrial applications; XNA catalysts have not displaced them
- Most commercial enzyme markets use engineered proteins (proteases, amylases, lipases, etc.) with applications in detergents, food processing, and biocatalysis for chemical synthesis

**Synthetic Biology and Astrobiology:**
- Research on synthetic genetic systems has continued, including fully synthetic bacterial genomes and alternative base pairing systems
- No concrete evidence of extraterrestrial life with alternative biochemistries has emerged as of 2024; all astrobiology discoveries remain microbial markers or prebiotic chemistry

**Therapeutic Nucleic Acids:**
- Nucleic acid therapeutics have advanced significantly with approved antisense drugs (e.g., Spinraza for spinal muscular atrophy) and CRISPR-based treatments
- Catalytic nucleic acids in medicine have been limited primarily to ribozymes studied in research contexts, not approved therapeutics

**Business and Commercial Impact:**
- No major biotechnology companies have commercialized XNA-based catalysts or enzymes at scale
- Companies specializing in synthetic biology and nucleic acid therapeutics typically focus on established modifications rather than completely novel backbones

The 2014 paper advanced fundamental understanding of catalysis as an "emergent property" across polymer types, but these discoveries have not translated into practical catalysts displacing proteins in industry or medicine.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

No explicit predictions were made in the article.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 7/9**

This article addresses fundamental questions about life's chemical requirements and the potential for alternative biochemistries, which represents significant scientific importance. The XNA catalysis work was a meaningful contribution to understanding the boundaries of catalytic function and evolutionary possibilities. However, the practical applications envisioned in 2014 have not materialized at scale, limiting its transformational impact compared to other biotechnological advances of the period.
