# CRISPR Gene Editing in Human Embryos: Not So Fast (April 2015)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses the first confirmed use of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in human embryos, published by researchers from Sun Yat-Sen University. The team attempted to edit the beta-globin gene (HBB) responsible for beta-thalassemia in human zygotes, but encountered significant technical challenges. The experiment revealed low efficiency of homologous recombination, mosaic embryos (where not all cells were successfully edited), off-target effects, and unintended mutations when the similar delta-globin gene interfered with the repair process.

The author notes that the paper had been rejected by both Nature and Science, and these disappointing results actually strengthened the case for the moratorium on human germline editing that had been proposed earlier that year. The key takeaway was that CRISPR editing in human embryos proved much more difficult than in other cell types or mouse embryos, suggesting that clinical applications were further off than hoped.

## 2. HISTORY

After this 2015 paper, several major developments occurred in human germline gene editing:

**Technical Progress:**
- Subsequent research confirmed that human embryo editing remained technically challenging, though improvements were made in reducing mosaicism and off-target effects
- The 2015 study used abnormal tripronuclear (3PN) zygotes, which researchers later moved away from to use more normal diploid embryos

**Policy and Regulatory Response:**
- In December 2015, the international summit on human gene editing called for restrictions but not a complete moratorium
- Many countries strengthened or clarified their prohibitions on germline modifications
- The NIH reiterated its position against funding human embryo research
- Professional societies developed more detailed guidelines and oversight frameworks

**Key Scientific Milestones:**
- **2017:** Shoukhrat Mitalipov's team at OHSU published improved CRISPR editing in human embryos correcting a MYBPC3 mutation causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
- **2018:** He Jiankui announced the birth of CRISPR-edited twins Lulu and Nana, sparking international condemnation and leading to his criminal conviction in China
- **2019-2022:** Multiple international panels and organizations called for moratoriums or strict oversight of heritable human genome editing
- **2021:** WHO issued recommendations against clinical applications of heritable human genome editing

**Clinical Reality:**
- No approved treatments using germline editing have been developed
- Most focus shifted to somatic (non-heritable) gene editing applications
- Beta-thalassemia treatments using CRISPR on adult cells (like CTX001) showed promise and were approved, but these target somatic cells, not embryos

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions that can be evaluated against subsequent developments:

• **"The era of human germ-line manipulation looks like it's going to have to wait a bit"** - **ACCURATE**. While the first CRISPR-edited babies were born in 2018, this was widely condemned as premature and unethical. Clinical applications remain illegal in most countries, with widespread calls for moratoriums continuing through 2024.

• **"It's still on the way"** - **PARTIALLY ACCURATE**. The technology has advanced, and germline editing happened in the controversial 2018 case, but widespread clinical use has not materialized due to technical, ethical, and regulatory barriers.

• **Implicit in the technical assessment was that the specific challenges (mosaicism, off-target effects, low HDR efficiency) would delay clinical application** - **HIGHLY ACCURATE**. These technical challenges persisted as major obstacles, and while improvements were made, they remained significant concerns preventing responsible clinical implementation.

• **"Going to be more complicated than it might have looked"** - **HIGHLY ACCURATE**. The subsequent years revealed not just technical complications, but also profound ethical, societal, and regulatory complexities that the field continues to grapple with today.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 9/10**

This article was remarkably prescient in capturing a pivotal moment in gene editing history. It correctly identified that the technical challenges were more substantial than anticipated and that these would slow clinical progress. The 2015 paper it discussed marked the beginning of serious ethical and technical debates about human germline editing that continue today, making this a foundational piece in understanding the trajectory of CRISPR's development and applications.
