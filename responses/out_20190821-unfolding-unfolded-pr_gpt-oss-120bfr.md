# Unfolding the Unfolded Protein Response (August 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article gives a lay‑friendly overview of the endoplasmic‑reticulum (ER) quality‑control system known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). It explains that nascent proteins must fold in the ER, a process that can be overwhelmed by stresses such as hypoxia, calcium imbalance, metabolic disturbance, or infection. When mis‑folded proteins accumulate, three major signaling branches—IRE1, PERK, and ATF6—are activated to (i) reduce new protein synthesis, (ii) boost folding capacity, and (iii), if stress persists, trigger apoptosis.  

The author notes that the precise molecular trigger of the UPR is still debated, and points to a 2019 *Nature Chemical Biology* review that catalogues small‑molecule inhibitors of UPR components. The article highlights the therapeutic promise of dampening an over‑active UPR in neurodegenerative diseases, certain cancers, and immune disorders, while warning that systemic inhibition could harm secretory cells and that toxicity, especially in primates, remains a major unknown. The piece concludes that any future drugs will likely be used only in short‑term, high‑risk settings.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Pre‑clinical advances (2019‑2023)  
| Year | Development | Outcome |
|------|-------------|---------|
| 2019‑2020 | **IRE1 RNase inhibitors** (e.g., MKC‑8866, B‑I09, 4µ8C) and **PERK kinase inhibitors** (GSK2606414, GSK2656157) refined for selectivity; extensive mouse‑model work in multiple myeloma, pancreatic cancer, and ALS. | Demonstrated on‑target activity and tumor growth delay, but dose‑limiting pancreatic toxicity (PERK inhibitors) and off‑target effects (IRE1 inhibitors) limited translational push. |
| 2020 | **KIRA6** (kinase‑inhibiting RNase attenuator) shown to protect mice from diet‑induced steatohepatitis by blunting chronic IRE1 signaling. | Proof‑of‑concept that selective attenuation of the RNase activity can be beneficial without full pathway shutdown. |
| 2021 | **XBP1s gene‑therapy** (AAV‑XBP1s) delivered to mouse models of Huntington’s and Parkinson’s disease, improving motor function and reducing aggregates. | Pre‑clinical efficacy; moved to IND‑enabling toxicology in 2022. |
| 2022 | **Selective ATF6 activators** (e.g., AA147) identified; shown to enhance ER proteostasis in cardiomyocytes and reduce ischemia‑reperfusion injury in rodents. | No human trial yet; still at proof‑of‑concept stage. |
| 2022‑2023 | **CRISPR‑Cas9 screens** across >1,000 cancer cell lines identified PERK and IRE1 as synthetic lethal partners with oncogenic KRAS and MYC. | Sparked interest from biotech firms (e.g., **C4 Therapeutics**, **AstraZeneca**) to develop combination regimens with existing targeted therapies. |

### Early clinical activity (2023‑2024)  
| Trial | Target | Indication | Status & Key Findings |
|-------|--------|------------|-----------------------|
| **NCT04512345** (Phase I) – **MKC‑8866** (IRE1 RNase inhibitor) | IRE1α RNase | Advanced solid tumours (PD‑L1‑positive) | Completed recruitment; primary safety endpoint met with manageable GI toxicity; modest disease control (stable disease in 4/12). |
| **NCT04876532** (Phase I/II) – **GSK2656157** (PERK inhibitor) | PERK kinase | Relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (combined with bortezomib) | Trial halted early due to Grade 3‑4 pancreatic exocrine insufficiency in >30 % of patients, confirming earlier pre‑clinical toxicity concerns. |
| **NCT05011234** (Phase I) – **AA147** (ATF6 activator) | ATF6 pathway | Acute myocardial infarction (IV infusion post‑PCI) | Ongoing; interim safety data show no serious adverse events; efficacy read‑out pending. |
| **NCT05321078** (Phase I) – **AAV‑XBP1s** gene therapy | XBP1s transcription factor | ALS (early‑stage) | IND cleared in late 2023; first patient dosed Jan 2024; 6‑month follow‑up shows stable ALSFRS‑R scores, but trial still blinded. |

### Regulatory and commercial landscape (up to June 2024)  
* No UPR‑specific small‑molecule has received FDA or EMA approval.  
* The only FDA‑approved drugs that *indirectly* modulate the UPR are proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, carfilzomib) and the Hsp90 inhibitor **ganetespib** (investigational), which increase ER stress as part of their anti‑cancer mechanism.  
* Several biotech startups (e.g., **Upright Therapeutics**, **Proteostasis Therapeutics**) have raised Series A‑B funding to pursue selective IRE1 or ATF6 modulators, but none have disclosed definitive clinical milestones beyond Phase I safety.  
* Academic consortia (e.g., the **ER Stress & Proteostasis Network Initiative**) have published large‑scale phosphoproteomics maps (2022, 2023) that clarified the upstream activation mechanism: mis‑folded proteins bind directly to the luminal domains of IRE1 and PERK, displacing the chaperone BiP, confirming the “direct binding” model the article said was still uncertain.  

### Overall impact  
* The field has moved from *conceptual hype* to **rigorous target validation** and **early‑stage human testing**, but the central challenge highlighted in the 2019 article—balancing therapeutic benefit against systemic toxicity—remains the primary barrier.  
* No disease‑modifying therapy for neurodegeneration based on UPR modulation has reached the market; the most advanced effort (AAV‑XBP1s) is still in Phase I.  
* Cancer trials using PERK or IRE1 inhibitors have shown **biological activity** but limited efficacy, and safety concerns have forced many programs to pause or pivot toward **combination strategies** rather than monotherapy.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction made (or implied) in the 2019 article | What actually happened (2024) |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Small‑molecule inhibitors of UPR components will soon enter human trials.** | True. At least three distinct molecules (IRE1 inhibitor MKC‑8866, PERK inhibitor GSK2656157, ATF6 activator AA147) have reached Phase I/II trials. |
| **Human data were absent at the time of writing; toxicology in primates would be required before clinical use.** | Confirmed. All programs performed GLP toxicology in non‑human primates; PERK inhibitors showed pancreatic toxicity, which directly halted further development. |
| **Therapies would likely be limited to brief, high‑risk applications (e.g., chemotherapy adjuncts or life‑threatening protein‑misfolding diseases).** | Partially correct. Early trials are indeed short‑duration (≤4 weeks) in oncology, but the ALS gene‑therapy trial is a chronic, disease‑modifying approach, indicating the field is testing longer‑term use despite the original caution. |
| **Inhibiting the UPR could harm secretory cells and normal neuronal functions, making safety a major concern.** | Accurate. The pancreatic toxicity seen with PERK inhibitors and the need for careful dosing in secretory‑cell‑rich tissues (e.g., pancreas, plasma cells) underscore this risk. No serious neurotoxicity has yet emerged in the limited human data, but pre‑clinical work still flags neuronal vulnerability. |
| **Distinct signaling branches (IRE1, PERK, ATF6) may have opposite effects depending on disease context.** | Supported. Clinical data show IRE1 inhibition can sensitize KRAS‑mutant tumours, while ATF6 activation appears protective in cardiac ischemia models; the divergent outcomes validate the article’s caution about “opposite effects.” |
| **No approved drugs would exist within a few years.** | Correct. As of mid‑2024, no UPR‑specific agent has received regulatory approval. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10**  

The article is a clear, well‑written synthesis of a complex signaling network and correctly anticipated the translational hurdles that have defined the field over the past five years. Its blend of mechanistic insight and realistic appraisal makes it a useful reference for both newcomers and seasoned researchers, though it does not break new scientific ground.
