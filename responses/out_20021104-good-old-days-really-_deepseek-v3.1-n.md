# The Good Old Days of Really Bad Teeth, Revisited (November 2002)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief commentary reflects on dental health in historical Native American populations who depended on corn as a staple food. The author notes that traditional corn grinding between stone implements introduced significant amounts of grit and rock powder into the diet, which caused severe tooth wear over time. This mechanical wear made teeth more susceptible to decay, while the sugar content of corn further promoted bacterial growth and dental problems. The article also raises questions about the gastrointestinal consequences of regularly consuming rock powder, wondering about intestinal troubles that might result from what is essentially eating polishing compound.

The piece appears to be a follow-up to earlier commentary, possibly responding to romanticized views of pre-industrial diets, with the author receiving input from an archaeologist about the practical realities of traditional food preparation methods.

## 2. HISTORY

The specific claims in this article align with well-established archaeological and anthropological findings that have been consistently supported in subsequent research. Studies of dental pathology in pre-industrial populations have consistently shown that:

- Hunter-gatherer populations generally had better dental health than early agricultural societies
- The transition to agriculture, particularly maize cultivation in the Americas, correlated with increases in dental caries and wear
- Dental wear patterns from grit contamination are well-documented in archaeological remains

However, I cannot provide specific details about whether this particular article gained significant traction, led to policy changes, or resulted in concrete research developments. The general principle that traditional stone grinding introduced dental abrasives remains accepted in archaeological science.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article itself does not contain explicit predictions about future developments, treatments, or technological advances. It is primarily a historical/anthropological reflection rather than a forward-looking analysis. The questions raised about gastrointestinal consequences of grit consumption were speculative rather than predictive in nature.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**

This is a brief, niche commentary about historical dental health with very limited broader implications for biotechnology, medicine, or public policy. While it touches on interesting anthropological concepts, it lacks substantive content relevant to biotech industry developments or therapeutic advances mentioned in the prompt template's instructions.
