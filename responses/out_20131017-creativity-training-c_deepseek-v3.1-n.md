# Creativity Training For Creative Creators (October 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2013 article from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog discusses the burgeoning "creativity industry" - the ecosystem of TED talks, business consulting, corporate workshops, and popular literature promising to teach creativity and innovation. The author references Thomas Frank's Salon critique of this phenomenon and expresses his own skepticism about whether creativity can actually be taught or enhanced. 

The core argument is that "creativity" and "innovation" have become corporate buzzwords - feel-good terms that organizations use to project an image they think they should have, rather than representing genuine processes or outcomes. The article questions whether "gain-of-function" in creativity is achievable, suggesting that while harmful influences can be avoided, actively ramping up creative output in normal individuals, groups, or companies remains elusive despite the proliferation of consultants and training programs promising exactly that.

## 2. HISTORY

Since this 2013 article, several notable developments have occurred in how creativity and innovation are approached:

**Corporate Innovation Programs Evolved**: By the late 2010s, many companies shifted from generalized "creativity training" toward more specific methodologies. Design thinking became widely adopted in corporate settings, with firms like IDEO popularizing structured approaches to innovation. However, mixed results emerged - while some companies reported success, others found these programs produced more process than actual innovation.

**Academic Research Progressed**: Research into creativity and innovation continued throughout the 2010s, but meta-analyses (such as those by psychologists studying creative problem-solving) generally found mixed evidence for creativity training effectiveness. The field moved toward more nuanced understanding of creativity as domain-specific rather than a general skill, and recognition that environmental factors matter more than training programs alone.

**TED's Trajectory**: TED talks continued growing through the 2010s but faced criticism for oversimplification and style over substance, somewhat validating the article's skepticism. The format remained popular but the discourse around it became more nuanced.

**Corporate Outcomes**: Innovation consulting continued as a significant industry, with firms like McKinsey and Boston Consulting Group developing innovation practices. However, the 2020s brought challenges - many companies found that being "innovation theater" didn't translate to actual business results, leading to more emphasis on practical implementation and measurable outcomes rather than inspirational content alone.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article didn't make explicit forward-looking predictions, but rather expressed skepticism about several ongoing trends. Here's how those concerns aligned with subsequent developments:

• **Effectiveness of creativity training**: The author doubted whether creativity could be systematically enhanced through training programs. Subsequent research largely supported this skepticism - while some structured approaches showed modest benefits, there's no evidence that creativity training delivers dramatic improvements, and the effectiveness varies greatly by domain and individual.

• **Corporate buzzword nature**: The concern that "creativity" and "innovation" were being used as empty buzzwords proved largely accurate. Throughout the 2010s, these terms became increasingly prevalent in corporate marketing while often lacking substantive programs or results behind them. However, some organizations did develop more rigorous innovation processes.

• **Sustainability of the creativity industry**: The skepticism about the creativity consulting and training industry was partially warranted but incomplete. While some aspects proved faddish, the broader innovation consulting industry continued growing, adapting to focus more on practical implementation and measurable outcomes rather than inspiration alone.

## 4. INTEREST

**Rating: 6/10**

This article offers thoughtful industry perspective on the creativity training phenomenon, though it's more commentary on business trends than scientific analysis, limiting its long-term relevance compared to more empirical treatments of creativity research.
