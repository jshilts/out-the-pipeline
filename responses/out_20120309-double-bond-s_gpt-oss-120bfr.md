# Double‑Bond‑S (Mar 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article points out that the carbonyl (C=O) is a work‑horse in organic chemistry, yet its sulfur analogue (C=S) is far less common in pharmaceuticals.  The author attributes this to the intrinsic instability and unpleasant odor of simple thioketones, and to the higher reactivity of thioamides and thioureas compared with their oxygen‑containing counterparts.  Although a few drugs (e.g., methimazole) and research tools (e.g., thioperamide) do contain a thiocarbonyl, the functional group has a reputation for “trouble.”  The piece highlights rhodanines—a heterocycle that incorporates a C=S bond—as the most visible example of the problem, noting that they have been repeatedly flagged as undesirable in medicinal‑chemistry circles.  The author asks whether any thiocarbonyl motifs are better behaved, or whether the whole class is unfairly maligned because of a handful of problematic members.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Clinical use of thiocarbonyl‑containing drugs  
* **Thioamides** – Propylthiouracil (PTU) and methimazole remain the two main antithyroid agents worldwide.  Their market share has been stable; no new thioamide antithyroid drugs have entered the market since 2012.  
* **Thioureas** – The herbicide/antifungal thiourea class (e.g., diuron, isothiazolinone preservatives) continues to be used, but none have progressed to new human medicines after 2012.  
* **Thio‑heterocycles** – A few niche drugs retain a C=S bond, such as **thioguanine** (an antileukemic) and **thiothixene** (an atypical antipsychotic).  Their usage has not expanded dramatically; they remain low‑volume, legacy products.  

### Drug‑discovery trends  
* **Rhodanine as a PAINS motif** – Starting around 2013, the “PAINS” (pan‑assay interference compounds) literature, especially the work of Baell & Walters (2014), singled out rhodanines as a frequent source of false‑positive hits in high‑throughput screens.  Most major pharma screening pipelines now automatically flag or discard rhodanine‑like structures.  A few academic groups have reported genuine activity for rhodanine derivatives (e.g., antibacterial or antiviral leads), but none have advanced beyond early‑stage preclinical work.  
* **Thioamide peptide mimics** – Since 2012, thioamide incorporation into peptide backbones has been explored as a strategy to increase protease resistance and to introduce spectroscopic handles.  Notable examples include thioamide‑modified β‑amyloid inhibitors (published 2015) and thioamide‑containing peptide probes for kinase activity (published 2018).  These remain research tools; no thioamide‑modified peptide has yet received FDA approval.  
* **Thio‑semicarbazones and related chelators** – Compounds such as **Triapine** (a thio‑semicarbazone ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor) entered Phase II/III trials for cancer but have not achieved regulatory approval as of 2024.  Their development illustrates that sulfur‑bearing carbonyl analogues can be pursued, but success rates are comparable to other heterocycles.  

### Business and policy impact  
* No major biotech companies have been founded on a core thiocarbonyl platform since 2012.  
* Regulatory guidance (e.g., FDA’s 2015 “Guidance for Industry: Assessing the Toxicity of Sulfur‑Containing Functional Groups”) mentions thioamides and thioureas but does not impose special restrictions beyond standard toxicology requirements.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Implicit/Explicit prediction in the 2012 article | What actually happened |
|---|---|
| **“Thiocarbonyls are avoided because they are unstable and smelly; therefore they will remain rare in drugs.”** | Largely true.  Only a handful of stable thioamides (methimazole, PTU) and thioureas continue to be used clinically.  No new blockbuster drugs with a C=S bond have appeared. |
| **“Rhodanines are the most high‑profile problematic thiocarbonyls.”** | Confirmed.  Rhodanines became a textbook example of PAINS; most screening libraries now exclude them.  Their reputation has only hardened. |
| **“Are there better‑behaved thiocarbonyls?”** (implied hope for alternatives) | Some progress: thioamide‑modified peptides have shown improved protease stability and are used as research probes, but none have become marketed therapeutics.  Thio‑semicarbazones have reached late‑stage trials but have not yet succeeded. |
| **“The functional‑group stigma may be overblown.”** | Partially disproved.  While a few well‑behaved thiocarbonyls exist, the overall perception of risk remains justified in medicinal chemistry practice. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article touches on a chemically interesting niche (thiocarbonyl chemistry) and anticipates a debate that has indeed shaped screening practices (PAINS/rhodanine), but the practical impact on drug development has been modest.
