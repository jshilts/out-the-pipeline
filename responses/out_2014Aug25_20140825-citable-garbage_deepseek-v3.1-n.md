# Retrospective Analysis: "Citable Garbage" (2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2014 Science Magazine blog post by Derek Lowe exposed the transformation of *Experimental and Clinical Cardiology* from a reputable journal into a predatory publication. The article revealed that after being sold to new owners, the journal would publish virtually any submission for a $1200 fee sent to a Turks and Caicos Islands bank account. Lowe described how Ottawa Citizen reporter Tom Spears successfully submitted a nonsensical paper—created by doing find-and-replace substitutions on an HIV paper to make it about cardiology—which was accepted without question. The journal's "peer review" promises were clearly fraudulent, and legitimate organizations like the International Academy of Cardiovascular Sciences found their names misappropriated.

## 2. HISTORY

The years following this exposé saw the predatory publishing problem **explode rather than diminish**. Jeffrey Beall's List of predatory publishers, referenced in Lowe's article, continued expanding until Beall took it down in 2017 amid pressure and legal threats. However, the problem persisted and arguably worsened:

- **Growth of predatory publishing**: By 2017, it was estimated that over 8,000 predatory journals published more than 400,000 articles annually
- **Institutional responses**: Major academic institutions and funding bodies began developing policies to combat predatory journals, but enforcement remained challenging
- **Beall's List shutdown**: In January 2017, Beall removed his influential list, which had been a key resource for identifying predatory publishers
- **Continued proliferation**: New predatory publishers emerged faster than they could be tracked, exploiting researchers desperate for publications
- **COVID-19 acceleration**: The pandemic saw a surge in predatory journals capitalizing on rushed research and publication pressure

Significantly, the specific journal mentioned—*Experimental and Clinical Cardiology*—largely faded from prominence, but the underlying business model thrived.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Correct predictions:**
- Lowe correctly anticipated that predatory publishers would "ride [the scam] as long as a shred of reputation clings to the journal's name, or as long as people send them money"—this persisted and expanded
- His warning that funding these publishers means "funding a bunch of scam artists" proved prescient as the scale of the problem grew
- The prediction that researchers using such publications are "deciding to become a scam artist yourself" accurately captured the ethical erosion in academia

**Underestimated dynamics:**
- Lowe didn't anticipate how **institutionally embedded** predatory publishing would become—with some universities unofficially tolerating or even encouraging publications in such venues to boost metrics
- The **international scope** expanded far beyond what was described—countries without robust research evaluation systems became particularly vulnerable
- The **sophistication** of predatory operations grew—many developed convincing-looking websites, fabricated impact factors, and created elaborate fake editorial boards
- The **scale** vastly exceeded expectations—predatory publishing became a billion-dollar industry

The core problem Lowe identified—that these journals "will publish any study that is scientifically sound" as cover for accepting anything—became even more entrenched than anticipated.

## 4. INTEREST

**Decile Score: 4/9**

This article scores in the 4th decile (40-49th percentile) for long-term importance. While the piece accurately identified an important systemic problem, it addressed a issue that has proven **interminable rather than transformative**. 

The article's importance lies in being one of the high-profile early warnings about predatory publishing, raising awareness in the broader scientific community. However, the problem it identified has persisted with remarkable stubbornness, suggesting the article had limited real-world impact on the behavior it critiqued. The exposure didn't stem the tide of predatory publishing; if anything, the problem grew more sophisticated.

The score of 4 reflects that while the topic was important and the analysis sound, the article represents more of an accurate diagnosis of a chronic condition than a catalytic intervention. It belongs to the substantial category of important-but-not-transformative scientific commentary that correctly identifies problems but doesn't lead to their resolution. The piece achieved high *accuracy* in its predictions but limited *impact* in changing outcomes.
