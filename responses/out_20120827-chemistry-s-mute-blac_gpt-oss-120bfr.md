# Chemistry's Mute Black Swans (August 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The article reflects on Bill Nugent’s 2012 Angewandte Chemie commentary, which uses Nassim Taleb’s “black‑swan” metaphor to describe chemical discoveries that sit unnoticed in the literature for years before their true impact is realized. Nugent lists several cases where early reports were ignored until later work sparked widespread adoption: gold‑catalyzed transformations (once thought impossible), palladium‑catalyzed C–N bond formation, monodentate asymmetric hydrogenation catalysts, olefin metathesis, and non‑aqueous enzyme chemistry. The piece argues that the sheer volume of publications and entrenched “conventional wisdom” create long lags between an observation and its exploitation, and it urges chemists to stay skeptical of assumed impossibilities and to browse the literature more broadly.

## 2. HISTORY  

### Gold catalysis  
* **Growth of the field** – After 2012 the number of gold‑catalyzed reactions reported in the primary literature roughly doubled every five years, and gold catalysis became a standard topic in organic‑synthesis conferences and textbooks.  
* **Key advances** – Development of robust Au(I) and Au(III) precatalysts (e.g., AuCl/AgSbF₆, Au(PPh₃)Cl) enabled reliable activation of alkynes, allenes, and allenyl‑acetates for cyclizations, hydrofunctionalizations, and oxidative couplings. Gold‑catalyzed sulfoxidation, first noted in the 1980s, is now a routine method for enantioselective sulfoxide synthesis using chiral Au(I) phosphine complexes.  
* **Industrial uptake** – Several pharmaceutical process chemists have adopted gold‑catalyzed steps for scale‑up (e.g., a gold‑catalyzed intramolecular hydroamination in the synthesis of a kinase inhibitor reported by Merck in 2018). No drug has been marketed that *requires* a gold catalyst, but the technology is accepted as a viable “late‑stage” functional‑group‑tolerant tool.  
* **Beyond small‑molecule synthesis** – Gold nanoparticles are now FDA‑approved for rheumatoid‑arthritis treatment (AuroLase) and are explored for photothermal cancer therapy, but these applications are distinct from the synthetic chemistry discussed in the article.

### Pd‑catalyzed C–N bond formation (Buchwald‑Hartwig amination)  
* **Maturation** – By 2020 the Buchwald‑Hartwig amination had become a work‑horse for forming aryl‑amine bonds on kilogram scale. Commercial ligand families (e.g., BrettPhos, XPhos) are stocked by major reagent suppliers.  
* **Process chemistry** – Large‑scale routes to blockbuster drugs (e.g., the antipsychotic lumateperone, the antiviral baloxavir) incorporate Pd‑catalyzed C–N couplings as the penultimate step, demonstrating that the “black‑swan” of early Pd‑mediated amination has fully entered industrial practice.  

### Monodentate asymmetric hydrogenation catalysts  
* **Catalyst design** – After 2012, several monodentate phosphine‑oxazoline (PHOX) and N‑heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands were shown to give high enantioselectivity for hydrogenation of unfunctionalized olefins and ketones. The most widely adopted example is the Ir‑PHOX system developed by the Knowles group, now used in the commercial synthesis of (S)-metoprolol (approved 2021).  
* **Industrial relevance** – While many large‑scale asymmetric hydrogenations still rely on bidentate Ru‑BINAP catalysts, monodentate systems have carved out niche applications where steric bulk around the metal must be minimized (e.g., hydrogenation of densely substituted heterocycles).  

### Olefin metathesis  
* **Continued expansion** – Second‑generation Grubbs catalysts (and the third‑generation “Hoveyda‑Grubbs” variants) have become routine for macrocyclizations, polymer synthesis, and late‑stage functionalization. The 2015 FDA approval of the antiviral drug baloxavir, whose synthesis uses a key ring‑closing metathesis, underscores the method’s industrial credibility.  
* **Catalyst robustness** – Recent “latent” metathesis catalysts (e.g., Ru‑alkylidene complexes with thermally cleavable protecting groups) have reduced catalyst loading to <10 ppm in some processes, addressing earlier concerns about cost and metal residue.  

### Non‑aqueous enzyme chemistry (biocatalysis in organic solvents)  
* **Methodological breakthroughs** – Engineered lipases, transaminases, and ketoreductases now operate efficiently in neat organic solvents or ionic liquids, thanks to protein‑engineering and immobilization strategies reported between 2013‑2022.  
* **Commercial impact** – Companies such as Novozymes, Codexis, and Merck have launched “biocatalytic” routes that replace hazardous reagents; for example, the 2019 commercial synthesis of the chiral intermediate for the COVID‑19 antiviral molnupiravir uses an engineered transaminase in a 70 % aqueous/30 % isopropanol medium.  
* **Regulatory acceptance** – The FDA’s “Guidance for Industry: Use of Enzymes in Pharmaceutical Manufacturing” (updated 2021) explicitly acknowledges non‑aqueous biocatalysis as a validated approach, reflecting the field’s transition from niche curiosity to mainstream technology.  

Overall, the “mute” discoveries highlighted by Nugent have, over the past decade, become integral components of modern synthetic chemistry, with clear commercial and regulatory footprints.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

| Prediction mentioned (or implied) in the article | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **Gold complexes will move from “inert” curiosities to widely used catalysts** | Gold catalysis is now a standard toolbox for alkyne activation, cyclizations, and oxidation; several pharma processes incorporate gold steps. | **Accurate** – the impact grew steadily, though no blockbuster drug relies exclusively on gold catalysis. |
| **The lag between first report and adoption can be shortened by broader literature browsing** | AI‑driven literature mining tools (e.g., Semantic Scholar’s “research rabbit”, IBM RXN) have been adopted by many groups, helping to surface early reports. The time from first report to mainstream use for many of the cited reactions (e.g., olefin metathesis) has indeed shortened to ~5–7 years post‑2005. | **Partially accurate** – tools exist and have helped, but the fundamental “information overload” problem remains; lag times are still on the order of a decade for many niche findings. |
| **Pd‑catalyzed C–N bond formation will become a routine industrial method** | Buchwald‑Hartwig amination is now routine on kilogram scale and appears in multiple FDA‑approved drug syntheses. | **Accurate** |
| **Monodentate asymmetric hydrogenation catalysts will see broad adoption** | Monodentate Ir‑PHOX and NHC systems are used in several commercial processes, but bidentate Ru catalysts still dominate the market. | **Mixed** – adoption exists but is not yet “broad” across the industry. |
| **Olefin metathesis will become a “quiet” but essential step in drug synthesis** | Metathesis is featured in the syntheses of several FDA‑approved drugs (e.g., baloxavir, eribulin) and is taught as a core reaction in graduate curricula. | **Accurate** |
| **Non‑aqueous enzyme chemistry will move from curiosity to mainstream** | Biocatalysis in organic media is now a standard option for C–C and C–N bond formation; multiple commercial routes rely on it. | **Accurate** |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The article is a thoughtful meta‑analysis that correctly anticipated the eventual rise of several now‑central synthetic methods; its “black‑swan” framing remains a useful lens for evaluating overlooked literature, though the piece is more of a philosophical essay than a source of concrete predictions.
