# Is Palbociclib Promising? Or Not? (April 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article analyzes Pfizer's palbociclib based on data presented at the AACR meeting in 2014. The drug showed a near-doubling in progression-free survival (PFS) when added to standard care for advanced breast cancer, leading to many news outlets calling the results "promising." However, the article's author notes a critical issue: the initial analysis showed no statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS). The piece draws parallels to Avastin's experience, where provisional breast cancer approval based on PFS data was later revoked when OS benefits failed to materialize. The author cautions that while the PFS effect suggests potential, the lack of OS benefit in early data raises important questions about the drug's true clinical value.

## 2. HISTORY

After this article's publication, palbociclib's development trajectory proved more successful than the initial concerns suggested:

**Regulatory Approval**: Palbociclib (brand name Ibrance) received FDA accelerated approval in February 2015 for postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, based on the PFS data the article discusses.

**Clinical Outcomes Unfolded**: Subsequent data collection did eventually show overall survival benefits. The PALOMA-3 trial later demonstrated improved OS in certain patient populations, helping address the core concern raised in the 2014 article. However, the magnitude of OS benefit remained more modest than the dramatic PFS improvements initially seen.

**Market Adoption**: Ibrance achieved significant commercial success, becoming one of Pfizer's top-selling drugs and a standard of care in HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.

**Clinical Impact**: Unlike Avastin's breast cancer indication (which was indeed revoked in 2011), palbociclib maintained its approval and became widely adopted, though ongoing debates continued about the magnitude of survival benefits relative to PFS improvements.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article contained several implicit and explicit predictions:

- **"Further collection of data will start to show a real OS effect"** - ✓ **PARTIALLY CORRECT**: Subsequent data did show OS benefits, though they remained more modest than PFS improvements suggested.

- **Comparison to Avastin's fate** - ✗ **NOT BORN OUT**: Palbociclib did not follow Avastin's trajectory; it maintained approval and achieved widespread clinical adoption.

- **Implication that PFS benefits might not translate to meaningful clinical value** - ✗ **OVERLY PESSIMISTIC**: While OS benefits were less dramatic than PFS, the drug did demonstrate meaningful clinical benefits that justified continued use.

- **Concern about drawing premature conclusions from PFS data alone** - ✓ **METHODOLOGICALLY SOUND**: The caution about distinguishing PFS from OS proved prescient as the field grappled with this distinction across multiple oncology drugs.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article demonstrates sophisticated scientific literacy in questioning surrogate endpoints and prioritizing overall survival over progression-free survival, a stance that has aged well methodologically even as palbociclib's specific case turned out more positively than anticipated.
