# Building Our Own Molecular Machines (September 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the 2017 paper by Kassem et al. from the University of Manchester describing a programmable molecular machine—a molecular-sized stereoselective synthesis system that can produce different stereoisomers of a compound by switching between configurations. The machine uses a hydrazone "rotary switch" that can be toggled between E and Z configurations using acid/base treatment, allowing selective formation of four different diastereomers from the same starting material.

The author frames this work within broader discussions of molecular nanotechnology and enzymology, suggesting that while full Drexler-style molecular assemblers remain distant, this represents progress toward programmable chemical synthesis. The piece acknowledges that the system still has limitations (giving 80:20 to 60:40 stereoisomer ratios rather than pure products) but emphasizes the conceptual breakthrough: programmable molecular-scale machines that can execute multi-step chemistry and switch states on command.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2017 University of Manchester work demonstrated an early, though limited, programmable synthetic machine. Since then, the field of synthetic molecular machines has seen notable developments, though not at the transformative commercialization scale once envisioned by Drexler-style nanotechnology advocates.

The field gained significant momentum from the 2016 Nobel Prize in Chemistry awarded to Sauvage, Stoddart, and Feringa for molecular machines, providing validation and mainstream recognition. The Manchester group has continued developing these systems, exploring proton-driven switching mechanisms and their application to synthetic chemistry problems.

However, practical applications have remained limited. No pharmaceutical compounds are manufactured commercially using such programmable molecular machine approaches as of several years after this work. While researchers have created increasingly sophisticated molecular switches, rotors, and assemblers, these remain primarily academic demonstrations. The complexity of organic chemistry compared to binary computing makes the scaling challenge substantial—organic synthesis has many more "letters in its alphabet" than just 0s and 1s.

Manufacturing adoption has been minimal. The pharmaceutical industry continues to rely on traditional synthetic methods, enzymatic processes, and emerging biocatalysis rather than synthetic molecular machines. While the field has advanced in academic settings, it hasn't reached the practical utility the author hoped might develop.

This suggests the article's analogy to early computer circuits was overly optimistic about timeline. While molecular machines hold theoretical promise, translating academic demonstrations to industrial applications has proven far more difficult than transitioning from vacuum tubes to silicon chips.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article made several implicit predictions about how molecular machine development would progress:

• **Modular molecular machines for complex synthesis**: The article suggested we'd develop "tougher, more general solutions: machine that will make whole ranges of molecules, the way we tell them to." *Status:* Not realized at scale. While academic research continues, few modular machines exist for practical synthesis, and none see widespread adoption.

• **Binary switching as a pathway to complex molecular synthesis**: The author argued binary switches analogous to computing could overcome complexity. *Status:* Binary switching remains an active area, but hasn't enabled the complex machinery envisioned. The field has found it difficult to reduce organics' complexity to simple binary decisions.

• **Rapid adoption after initial breakthrough**: The tone suggests early molecular machines would catalyze broader development. *Status:* Growth has been steady but modest. Nature has published additional molecular machine work, and researchers continue investigating switchable systems, but adoption in chemical industries has been minimal.

• **Emergence of commercial molecular machine applications**: The 2017 landmark would drive real-world applications. *Status:* No such commercial applications emerged. The work remains primarily academic, with little industrial uptake.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **5/10**

While the specific Manchester work was a incremental technical achievement, broader molecular machine research continued steadily but didn't achieve the transformative industrial impact hoped for. The piece captures an interesting moment in conceptual development, but the grand promises of molecular nanotechnology remain largely unfulfilled in practical terms.
