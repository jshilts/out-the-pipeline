# Merck Presses Ahead on Alzheimer’s (December 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This December 2012 commentary analyzes Merck's decision to advance its beta-secretase (BACE) inhibitor MK-8931 (verubecestat) into Phase III trials for Alzheimer's disease. The author expresses strong skepticism about the optimistic headlines, noting that the gamma-secretase pathway had already experienced multiple high-profile failures including Bristol-Myers Squibb's avagacestat and Lilly's semagacestat. The article highlights Merck's unusual choice to test the compound in moderate Alzheimer's patients rather than earlier-stage patients, contrasting with the industry trend toward earlier intervention. Despite acknowledging Merck's scientific courage, the author characterizes this as a "big roll of the dice" given the historical difficulties with BACE inhibitors, including challenges with selectivity and brain penetration.

## 2. HISTORY
The subsequent clinical history largely validated the article's skepticism. Merck's MK-8931 (verubecestat) failed spectacularly in Phase III trials. In February 2017, Merck halted the APECS trial (in prodromal Alzheimer's patients) after an interim analysis showed the drug was unlikely to demonstrate efficacy and actually showed cognitive worsening in some measures. The separate EPOCH trial in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's patients also failed to meet primary endpoints. Both trials were terminated early.

The broader class of BACE inhibitors continued to struggle massively. Eli Lilly's lanabecestat failed in 2018, AstraZeneca/Eli Lilly's AZD3293 failed in 2019, Eisai/Biogen's elenbecestat was discontinued in 2019, Novartis/Amgen's umibecestat was halted in 2019 due to cognitive worsening - demonstrating a consistent pattern of not only lack of efficacy but actual harm. By 2020, multiple major pharmaceutical companies had abandoned BACE inhibitor programs entirely.

Solanezumab, mentioned in the article as Lilly's lead antibody, ultimately failed in multiple Phase III trials by 2016-2017. The much-hyped anti-amyloid approach continued to disappoint until very recently - Biogen's aducanumab received controversial FDA approval in 2021 with questionable efficacy data, while lecanemab showed modest but statistically significant cognitive benefits in 2022. However, these came with significant safety concerns including brain swelling and microhemorrhages.

The predicted "three years away" timeline proved completely unrealistic - no effective Alzheimer's drug emerged by 2015, and those that eventually did showed only modest benefits with significant limitations.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
• **Gamma-secretase inhibitors would continue to struggle**: ✓ Correct - No gamma-secretase inhibitor has achieved clinical success or FDA approval to date. The pathway was largely abandoned.

• **Merck's BACE inhibitor was unlikely to succeed in moderate Alzheimer's patients**: ✓ Partially correct - The drug failed completely, but not specifically because of the patient population choice. It failed across multiple populations.

• **Solanezumab was unlikely to be a breakthrough**: ✓ Correct - Lilly's antibody failed in multiple Phase III trials by 2016-2017 despite massive investment.

• **BACE would prove extremely difficult to drug successfully**: ✓ Correct - The entire class showed consistent failures across multiple companies from 2017-2020 with some drugs actually worsening cognition.

• **Headlines about "three years away" were "insane"**: ✓ Correct - No effective drug emerged by 2015, and the first modestly effective treatments only appeared nearly a decade later with significant limitations.

• **Merck was taking a big risk with their PhII/III gamble**: ✓ Correct - The gamble resulted in complete failure, validating the author's risk assessment.

## 4. INTEREST
**Score: 8/9**

This article demonstrates exceptional scientific prescience, accurately predicting the failure of multiple high-profile Alzheimer's programs while the field was still optimistic. It correctly identified fundamental problems with the amyloid hypothesis approach and BACE inhibition specifically, making it a rare example of clear-eyed analysis that stood the test of time remarkably well.
