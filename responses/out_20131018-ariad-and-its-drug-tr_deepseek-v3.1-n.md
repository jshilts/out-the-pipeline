# Ariad (And Its Drug) In Trouble (October 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
This October 2013 commentary discusses the serious regulatory and safety crisis facing Ariad Pharmaceuticals and its drug Iclusig (ponatinib). The article reports that Ariad's Phase III trial comparing Iclusig to Gleevec (imatinib) had been completely stopped and patients were being taken off the drug due to safety concerns. Iclusig was at the time commercially available in both the U.S. and EU for resistant or intolerant chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia-chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The author questions whether the drug's approval remains warranted given that the pivotal PACE trial - which formed the basis for its marketing approval - was showing unfavorable safety findings. The piece expresses concern about the implications for patients needing treatment for resistant CML, as well as for Ariad as a company that depends on this product commercially.

## 2. HISTORY
Following this October 2013 crisis, several significant developments occurred:

**FDA Response (2013)**: The FDA immediately requested that Ariad suspend marketing and sales of Iclusig due to life-threatening blood clots and severe narrowing of blood vessels. This was a temporary suspension rather than a complete withdrawal.

**Labeling Changes and Return to Market (2013-2014)**: After safety data review, the FDA allowed Iclusig to return to the market in December 2013 with a revised label that included a black box warning about arterial and venous thrombosis and occlusions, and restricted its use to patients with T315I-positive CML or Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL, or those for whom no other tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy was indicated.

**Clinical Outcomes**: The drug did remain on the market but with significantly restricted indications. Iclusig was not withdrawn entirely because it provided a valuable treatment option for patients with specific mutations (particularly T315I mutation) that made them resistant to other available tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

**Company Impact**: Ariad faced substantial financial challenges following this crisis, including workforce reductions and restructuring. The company was eventually acquired by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company in February 2017 for approximately $5.2 billion, indicating that despite the safety crisis, the underlying technology and drug portfolio retained significant value.

**Ongoing Use**: Iclusig continues to be used today in its restricted indications for resistant CML patients with specific mutations where alternative treatments are not available or appropriate.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article's implicit predictions and their outcomes:

- **Prediction**: That the drug's approval might be completely revoked
  - **Outcome**: Partially correct - Iclusig was temporarily suspended but returned to market with restricted indications rather than complete withdrawal

- **Prediction**: Serious negative implications for Ariad as a company
  - **Outcome**: Correct - The company faced significant financial and operational challenges, leading to eventual acquisition by Takeda

- **Prediction**: Patients needing resistant CML treatment would lose access
  - **Outcome**: Partially correct in the short term, but the drug returned with appropriate restrictions, maintaining access for the highest-need patients with specific mutations

The broader picture shows this crisis led to more careful patient selection and appropriate restriction of the drug to high-need populations where the benefit-risk ratio was more favorable.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

This article addresses an important drug safety crisis that exemplifies the tension between rapid access to innovative therapies and patient safety, with lasting implications for regulatory approaches to accelerated approvals and post-marketing surveillance.
