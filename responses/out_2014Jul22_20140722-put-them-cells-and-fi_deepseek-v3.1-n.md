# Retrospective Analysis: "Put Them in Cells and Find Out" (Science, July 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article reported on groundbreaking experimental work from Ben Cravatt's group that sought to empirically determine how many proteins small molecules actually interact with in living cells—a fundamental question in drug discovery. Using a library of approximately 60 diverse compounds containing photoaffinity handles and alkyne tags for chemoproteomic capture, they treated PC-3 prostate cancer cells and identified protein binding partners. The key findings suggested that most small molecules hit multiple proteins (ranging from 1 to 9 in their study), and surprisingly, about half of the identified targets had no previously known small-molecule ligands. The work also revealed that some proteins act as "promiscuous binders" that non-specifically interact with many compounds, extending beyond well-known examples like CYP enzymes and albumin.

## 2. HISTORY

The Cravatt group's 2014 work represented a pivotal moment in chemical biology and has had profound and sustained impact on drug discovery practices. In the decade since publication, chemoproteomics—the methodology central to this study—has become a mainstream approach in pharmaceutical research. Companies like Frontier Medicines, Ambagon Therapeutics, and Vividion Therapeutics (acquired by Bayer for $2 billion in 2021) have built entire drug discovery platforms around these techniques.

Subsequent developments validated and extended the original findings:
- **Target deconvolution**: Chemoproteomics is now routinely used to identify mechanisms of action for phenotypic screening hits, solving a critical bottleneck in drug discovery
- **Expanded scope**: Studies have shown that even "undruggable" targets (transcription factors, scaffolding proteins) can harbor cryptic binding sites, as the original work suggested
- **Clinical translation**: Two notable examples are the discovery of sotorasib (targeting KRAS G12C) and several COVID-19 antiviral drugs, where chemoproteomic approaches helped identify binding sites and mechanisms
- **Improved methodology**: Advancements in mass spectrometry sensitivity and bioorthogonal chemistry have made these techniques more accessible and robust

The field has moved from academic curiosity to pharmaceutical industry standard practice, with most major pharma companies now maintaining chemoproteomics platforms.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Correct predictions:**
- **Multi-target engagement**: The article correctly anticipated that most small molecules hit multiple proteins, not single targets. This has been extensively validated and changed how we think about drug selectivity and polypharmacology
- **"Hidden" druggable targets**: The finding that non-enzymatic and scaffolding proteins could bind small molecules proved prescient. This opened up new therapeutic modalities like molecular glues and protein degradation approaches (PROTACs)
- **Promiscuous proteins**: The identification of proteins that broadly interact with small molecules has held up, with these often representing liability targets or important considerations in early ADME studies
- **Methodology importance**: The importance of unbiased experimental approaches over purely computational predictions was well-founded; chemoproteomics has become an essential complement to in silico methods

**Incomplete or incorrect predictions:**
- **Scale expansion**: While the 1-9 target range per compound was accurate for their specific library, subsequent studies with broader chemical diversity have shown even more extensive polypharmacology, with some compounds hitting dozens of targets
- **Technological diffusion**: The article didn't fully predict how rapidly these methods would become democratized—from specialized academic technique to widely available commercial service within a decade
- **Regulatory acceptance**: The impact on regulatory science and approval pathways was underestimated; chemoproteomics now plays roles in IND-enabling studies and safety assessments

## 4. INTEREST: **8/9**

This article ranks in the 90-99th percentile of significance. It described foundational work that fundamentally changed pharmaceutical research paradigms. The methodology it showcased has become standard practice across the industry, enabled billion-dollar acquisitions, and directly contributed to approved medicines. It addressed one of drug discovery's "eternal questions"—what do small molecules actually do in cells?—with elegant experimental evidence that has stood the test of time.

The work's influence extends beyond immediate practical applications to conceptual shifts: it helped move drug discovery from a "one drug, one target" paradigm toward understanding polypharmacology, contributed to the renaissance of phenotypic drug discovery, and provided empirical evidence for extending druggability beyond traditional target classes. The article's blend of rigorous methodology, surprising biological insights, and clear practical relevance warrants its high interest ranking.
