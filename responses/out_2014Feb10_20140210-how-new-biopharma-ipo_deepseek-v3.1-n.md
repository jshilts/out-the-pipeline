# Retrospective Analysis: "How the New BioPharma IPOs Have Been Doing" (Science Magazine, Feb 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article summarizes Bruce Booth's analysis of biotech IPO performance during the 2013-2014 window, highlighting mostly positive investor returns across different entry points. The piece emphasizes three key findings: (1) big winners were well-represented with "Top 10%" returns exceeding 5x, typical of top venture capital performance; (2) outcomes showed considerable spread with as many top-decile results as money-losing investments; and (3) post-IPO trading contributed significantly to returns, with many offerings trading up and some even doubling or tripling after going public.

The article positions this performance as stronger than many would have predicted, noting that despite predictions of a market dip, the sector "still seems to be humming along." It carefully distinguishes between different classes of investors—founders, venture capital rounds, IPO buyers, and after-market purchasers—acknowledging they would have "profoundly different returns" while suggesting most categories had reason for optimism.

## 2. HISTORY

The timing of this article proved remarkably prescient, as it captured the early stages of what became known as the "biotech bubble" of 2014-2015. Following publication, the biotech IPO market accelerated dramatically through 2014 and into early 2015, with the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (NBI) peaking in July 2015 at nearly triple its 2011 lows.

However, the party ended abruptly. From July 2015 through February 2016, biotech stocks lost approximately 40% of their value, with many recent IPOs declining 60-80%. Companies like Juno Therapeutics, which had gone public in December 2014 at $24 and traded as high as $54, fell below $20. Pharmacyclics, often cited as a success story in 2014, was acquired by AbbVie in 2015 for $21 billion, but many other high-fliers from the IPO window struggled.

The post-2016 period saw increased selectivity from investors and regulators. The FDA became more stringent about clinical trial design and endpoints, contributing to high-profile failures like Sarepta's early rejection for Exondys 51 and multiple CAR-T safety concerns. By 2017-2018, IPO activity slowed significantly, with investors demanding more mature clinical data and clearer regulatory pathways.

The subsequent 2018-2020 period brought renewed interest, particularly around gene therapy and immunotherapy platforms, but with more measured valuations. The COVID-19 pandemic created another boom cycle (2020-2021), followed by another significant correction in 2022 as interest rates rose and speculative enthusiasm waned.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**What the article got right:**
- The acknowledgment that post-IPO performance would be "subject to constant revision every trading day" proved crucial—the volatility dwarfed any initial IPO returns
- The recognition of a "considerable spread of outcomes" accurately anticipated that IPO success wouldn't be evenly distributed
- The caution that "no one's made any money at all until they've said 'sell'" was prescient given how many paper gains evaporated in the 2015-2016 correction

**What the article missed:**
- Most significantly, it didn't anticipate the imminent 2015-2016 biotech crash that would wipe out most gains from this IPO window
- While noting "predictions of a dip," it suggested the market would "hum along"—failing to recognize the speculative bubble building
- The article's positive tone didn't adequately account for the sector's extreme cyclicality and regulatory risk concentration
- It didn't address the fundamental issue that many 2013-2014 IPOs involved companies with limited clinical data, high cash burn rates, and unclear commercial pathways

The piece essentially captured a snapshot during peak euphoria, treating strong performance as sustainable rather than recognizing it as a cyclical phenomenon that typically precedes a correction.

## 4. INTEREST

**Score: 6/9**

This article merits moderate-to-high interest (60th-70th percentile) for several reasons. First, it captures a crucial moment in biotech market history—the peak before a major correction—making it valuable for understanding market cycles and investor psychology. The piece provides useful data about IPO performance patterns and return distributions across different investor classes.

However, it falls short of the highest interest tier (7-9) because its analysis is relatively superficial and lacks the deeper critical perspective needed to identify the speculative bubble in progress. Articles published during market peaks that fail to recognize unsustainable dynamics are inherently limited in their long-term analytical value.

The retrospective value lies mainly in illustrating how market participants often focus on recent performance while underestimating cyclical risks—a lesson with broader applicability across technology sectors. The biotech industry's subsequent volatility, regulatory challenges, and ultimate maturation make this piece more interesting in hindsight than it likely appeared at publication.
