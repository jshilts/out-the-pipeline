# Finding Even More New Reactions By Looking For Them (November 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY

This 2011 article discusses a reaction discovery approach from the MacMillan group at Princeton published in *Science*, describing an "accelerated serendipity" method for finding new photoredox-catalyzed reactions. The approach used automated high-throughput setup to run approximately 1,000 random reactions per day, analyzing results with GC-MS to detect new transformations. The group discovered a dicyanobenzene radical coupling with tertiary amines that provides direct C-C bond formation for arylating adjacent to nitrogen—a reaction that was plausible but previously unknown. The article notes this methodology parallels earlier work by John Hartwig using similar brute-force screening approaches, though some critics objected that such automated methods lacked the elegance of rational design by "famous talented organic chemistry professors."

## 2. HISTORY

The accelerated serendipity approach described in 2011 became part of a broader transformation in chemical reaction discovery. Photoredox catalysis, the field MacMillan's group was exploring, experienced substantial growth and validation in the subsequent decade:

**Photoredox Catalysis Expansion**: Between 2012-2020, photoredox catalysis moved from a niche area to a mainstream methodology in organic synthesis. The field saw widespread adoption in both academic and industrial settings, with numerous pharmaceutical companies incorporating photoredox methods into drug discovery pipelines. The method's ability to generate reactive intermediates under mild conditions and its compatibility with complex molecules made it attractive for medicinal chemistry.

**Discovery Methodologies**: High-throughput screening for reaction discovery became increasingly automated. Biotech and pharmaceutical companies (including Merck's discovery of photoredox-based C-H functionalization methods) adopted similar approaches. However, the field also evolved toward more targeted discovery, combining automated screening with computational prediction and machine learning to guide experiments more efficiently.

**Industrial Adoption**: Companies investigating photoredox chemistry or employing rapid screening approaches (such as Schrödinger, Merck, Pfizer's fragment-based drug discovery platforms, or contract research organizations) did use photoredox methods for accessing chemical space. But by the early 2020s, reaction discovery shifted toward AI-guided approaches rather than purely combinatorial screening. The bottleneck that MacMillan identified—human analysis of results—was increasingly addressed through machine learning algorithms to parse high-throughput data.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

- **"Automated, high-throughput methods would allow ~1000 daily reactions"**: ✅ **Broadly validated**, though the field moved beyond pure randomization. High-throughput platforms became standard in pharmaceutical discovery, but evolved to incorporate predictive modeling rather than random screening.

- **"Greater appreciation for mixed-brainpower approaches"**: ✅ **Validated**. Academic-industrial collaborations increasingly combined broad screening with rational design, including Merck's and Pfizer's adoption of photoredox chemistry with targeted optimization.

- **Implicit prediction that combinatorial discovery could unlock photoredox transformations**: ✅ **Validated**. Photoredox catalysis expanded dramatically in scope and industrial use post-2015.

## 4. INTEREST

**Interest Decile: 7/9**

The article preceded and helped articulate a major methodological shift in chemical discovery, and its topics (photoredox catalysis and automated screening) subsequently saw significant adoption and impact. Though the approach was later refined, the core argument that discovery can be accelerated through systematic automation has been widely validated.
