# What Autism Epidemic? (May 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The 2011 commentary discusses a UK prevalence study that examined autism rates across age cohorts. The author notes that, unlike the “autism epidemic” narrative circulating in the media, the study found a stable prevalence of about 1 % across all ages, with no increase in older adults. The piece argues that the apparent rise in autism diagnoses over recent decades reflects broader diagnostic practices rather than a true rise in the underlying condition. It also points out that many adults who meet modern diagnostic criteria were never diagnosed and tend to be socially and economically disadvantaged. The author anticipates push‑back from “conspiracy‑theory” advocates.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Epidemiology after 2011**  
* **United States:** The CDC’s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network released updated prevalence estimates in 2014 (1 in 68 children) and 2020 (1 in 44 children). The upward trend is largely attributed to broadened diagnostic criteria (DSM‑5, 2013), increased screening, and greater awareness rather than evidence of a rising incidence.  
* **United Kingdom:** NHS data show a continued rise in recorded diagnoses among children (from ~1 % in 2011 to ~1.5 % by 2020). Parallel research (e.g., the 2016 “Children of the 90s” cohort) supports the view that diagnostic expansion, not a true increase in incidence, drives the numbers.  
* **Adult autism:** Post‑2011 studies have documented higher rates of previously undiagnosed autism in adult populations, confirming the commentary’s observation that many adults meet criteria without ever having been identified. Services for autistic adults have slowly expanded, though gaps remain.  

**Scientific advances**  
* Large‑scale genomic studies (e.g., the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative, 2014‑2022) identified hundreds of risk genes, reinforcing the view that autism is a highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental condition with strong genetic underpinnings.  
* No credible environmental or infectious “epidemic” cause has emerged; meta‑analyses of prenatal exposures, vaccines, and pollutants have consistently found no causal link to the rising prevalence.  

**Policy and public perception**  
* The UK Autism Act (2009) was followed by the 2021 “Autism Strategy” which increased funding for diagnosis and support services.  
* In the US, many states enacted autism insurance mandates and expanded Medicaid coverage for behavioral therapies.  
* Conspiracy‑theory narratives (e.g., vaccine‑autism claims) persisted online, but mainstream scientific and public‑health messaging has increasingly emphasized the diagnostic‑expansion explanation.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
- **Prediction in the article:** The rise in reported autism cases is due to increased diagnosis, not a true increase in the condition.  
  - **Outcome:** Supported. Subsequent prevalence data and genetic research indicate that diagnostic broadening, not a new environmental factor, explains most of the observed increase.  

- **Prediction in the article:** “Dark forces” will allege conspiracies and attack the study’s conclusions.  
  - **Outcome:** Accurate. Anti‑vaccine groups and other conspiracy communities continued to cite the “autism epidemic” narrative, often dismissing epidemiologic studies that show stable incidence.  

- **Implicit prediction:** Adults meeting modern criteria would be largely undiagnosed and disadvantaged.  
  - **Outcome:** Confirmed. Multiple adult‑focused studies (e.g., 2015‑2022 UK and US cohorts) found high rates of undiagnosed autism and associated socioeconomic challenges.  

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in the autism‑prevalence debate and correctly anticipates the diagnostic‑expansion explanation, making it moderately interesting for understanding how epidemiologic narratives evolve.
