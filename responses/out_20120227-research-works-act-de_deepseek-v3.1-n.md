# Is the Research Works Act Dead? (February 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article reports on Elsevier's withdrawal of support for the controversial Research Works Act (RWA), a bill that would have prohibited federal agencies from requiring public access to taxpayer-funded research. Elsevier's reversal came after significant backlash from scientists, researchers, and academic institutions who viewed the legislation as restricting open access to publicly funded scientific literature. The company acknowledged concerns that the Act appeared inconsistent with their stated support for expanding public access options, though they maintained their opposition to government mandates in this area. The article speculates that pressure from boycotts and community opposition drove this reversal, noting that the American Chemical Society had previously supported similar legislation in 2008 as part of the Association of American Publishers.

## 2. HISTORY
The Research Works Act died following Elsevier's withdrawal of support in February 2012, effectively ending any realistic chance of passage. This marked a pivotal moment for the open access movement. Within a year, the opposite outcome occurred: in March 2013, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy issued a directive requiring federal agencies with research budgets over $100 million to develop public access policies for federally funded research. This built upon the NIH Public Access Policy that the RWA had sought to overturn. 

Major developments followed:
- **2013**: The Fair Access to Science and Technology Research (FASTR) Act was introduced in Congress, essentially codifying open access requirements for federal research funding.
- **2014-2016**: Federal agencies including NSF, NASA, DOE, and others implemented public access policies.
- **2015**: Elsevier launched a formal open access publishing program, shifting their business model to accommodate these requirements.
- **2018-2022**: Major funders like the Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust strengthened open access mandates.
- **2022**: The White House issued updated guidance requiring free public access to federally funded research immediately upon publication.

The concrete impacts were significant: taxpayer-funded research became widely accessible to the public, scientists gained unrestricted access to federal research outputs, and publishers adapted their business models to open access frameworks.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article made explicit predictions about how publishers would respond:
- **Prediction**: "Maybe now the American Chemical Society will make a public statement" regarding their position on the RWA
  - **Outcome**: The ACS ultimately supported open access initiatives and adapted their publishing model, launching ACS Central Science as a fully open access journal in 2015.
- **Prediction**: Implicit expectation that publisher opposition would block public access mandates
  - **Outcome**: The opposite occurred - government mandates expanded dramatically within one year, rendering publisher objections largely irrelevant.
- **Prediction**: That withdrawal of RWA support would "create a less heated and more productive climate"
  - **Outcome**: This was partially correct - open access policies were implemented through administrative rather than legislative means, avoiding continued congressional battles.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
This article captures a pivotal turning point where academic publishing's attempt to restrict public access to taxpayer-funded research failed decisively, leading to the opposite outcome within just one year as open access became federal policy.
