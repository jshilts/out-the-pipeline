I notice the prompt template is intended for analyzing commentary articles about the biotechnology industry, but the provided article is actually a chocolate pecan pie recipe from 2007. 

The article has:
- Nothing to do with biotechnology
- No scientific or industry commentary to analyze
- No predictions to evaluate
- No developments to track

Given that this content falls completely outside the intended scope of analyzing biotechnology industry articles, I would assign it a score of **0** according to the guidelines, as it appears to be off-topic material rather than the biotechnology commentary the prompt template is designed to analyze.

If you have a biotechnology industry article you'd like me to analyze using this template, I'd be happy to help with that instead.
