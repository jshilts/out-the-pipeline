# An Unknown Author With Someone Else's Work. Why? (September 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article describes a peculiar case of scientific fraud involving a paper published in *Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications* (*BBRC*). The paper appears to be genuine scientific work on obesity research originally conducted by Bruce Spiegelman's laboratory at Harvard University. What makes this case unusual is that the authors listed on the publication appear to be fabrications—fake names with false contact information. The published results appear to match data that Spiegelman had discussed publicly at conferences. The central mystery presented is one of motive: why would someone go through the trouble of publishing legitimate scientific findings under fake names, rather than the typical fraud pattern of publishing fabricated data under real names? The article notes that Spiegelman's lab was behind work on the hormone irisin, which was claimed to be an exercise-induced myokine with metabolic benefits.

## 2. HISTORY

The retraction occurred on November 18, 2013 (about two months after the initial article), and the paper has been formally withdrawn from *BBRC*. The investigation revealed the paper was largely legitimate but submitted under fabricated authorship.

Although the fraud case itself was unusual, the underlying science held up under scrutiny and was later validated by other researchers. The key hormone in question was irisin, an exercise-induced myokine with potential metabolic benefits. Multiple subsequent studies confirmed irisin's existence and activity. The field around irisin has continued to attract research interest, even though its clinical applications have not yet materialized as therapies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article did not make explicit predictions about future scientific or clinical outcomes. Instead, it focused on highlighting an unusual instance of academic misconduct involving the fraudulent use of another researcher's legitimate data. Scientific progress depends on reliable attribution and trustworthy reporting, with fraud typically taking the form of fabricating data rather than authentic research presented under false authorship.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **3/10**
This case ranks low because it represents a minor, unusual episode of academic misconduct rather than a major breakthrough or widespread issue that shaped the biotechnology landscape. While scientifically valid (irisin research continued), the fraud was an anomaly without lasting impact on policy, business, or drug development.
