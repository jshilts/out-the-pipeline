# Ron Breslow, 1931-2017 (October 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY
This is an obituary tribute to Ronald Breslow, a prominent Columbia University chemistry professor who passed away in October 2017. The article highlights his broad-ranging contributions across multiple chemistry disciplines including physical organic chemistry, chemical biology, reaction mechanisms, enzyme mimics, and drug discovery. The author notes personal interactions with Breslow as a consultant and describes his prolific, collaborative approach to scientific problem-solving. The tribute also acknowledges two controversies in his career: issues with a remote-functionalization paper due to fraudulent data from a lab member, and a retracted "space dinosaurs" paper that contained self-plagiarism. Most significantly, the article emphasizes Breslow's development of vorinostat (Zolinza), the first FDA-approved histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, and notes the rare distinction of having both discovered a marketed drug and had a mechanistic intermediate named after him (the Breslow intermediate in benzoin condensation reactions).

## 2. HISTORY
Following the 2017 obituary, the key legacy mentioned—vorinostat—has continued to have important clinical impact. Vorinostat (Zolinza) was FDA-approved in 2006 for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), making it the first-in-class HDAC inhibitor. Subsequent post-2017 developments include:

**Clinical Applications**: Vorinostat remains an established treatment for CTCL, typically as second-line therapy. It has also been investigated for other cancers including Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and solid tumors, though with varying success rates. As of 2017-2024, vorinostat continues to be manufactured and prescribed for approved indications.

**HDAC Inhibitor Class Expansion**: Since 2017, additional HDAC inhibitors have gained approval, including belinostat (Beleodaq, 2014) for peripheral T-cell lymphoma and panobinostat (Farydak, 2015) for multiple myeloma. The HDAC inhibitor class has become an established epigenetic therapy approach in oncology.

**Scientific Recognition**: Breslow's scientific contributions remain widely cited, particularly the Breslow intermediate (dihydrothiazolium and dihydrooxazolium cations) which is fundamental to understanding thiamine-catalyzed reactions. His work on enzyme mimics and bioorganic chemistry continues to influence the field of chemical biology.

**Controversy Legacy**: The "space dinosaurs" self-plagiarism retraction from 2012 remains part of the historical record, but has not diminished his broader recognition for transformative contributions to chemistry and drug development.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
This obituary article did not contain explicit forward-looking predictions about future technology, therapies, or market developments. It was retrospective in nature, focusing on summarizing Breslow's career and legacy. The article's purpose was commemorative rather than predictive, reflecting on past achievements and events. No specific predictions about drug development timelines, market adoption rates, or research directions were made that could be evaluated against subsequent outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **6/10**

The article provides important historical context about a major figure in chemical biology and early epigenetic drug development, with lasting significance for understanding the origins of HDAC inhibitor therapeutics. While an obituary rather than a research article, it documents the career of someone whose drug discovery work had genuine clinical implementation, which elevates its long-term reference value above purely biographical content.
