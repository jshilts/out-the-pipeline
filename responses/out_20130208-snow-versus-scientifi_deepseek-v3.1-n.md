# Snow Versus Scientific Progress (February 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article is a personal blog post written by Derek Lowe during the Northeast US snowstorm of February 8, 2013. The author starts by noting that his company closed for the day due to heavy snowfall, and playfully observes that website traffic patterns will shift toward the Central and Pacific time zones since East Coast researchers are snowed in. He then reminisces about two memorable past storms: the January 1996 blizzard in New Jersey that dropped 39 inches of snow, and the winter of 1977–78 experienced during high school in Arkansas. The piece concludes with a lighthearted suggestion for readers to tackle an Elements jigsaw puzzle while snowbound. Despite the "scientific progress" framing in the title, the article is primarily a weather-related personal narrative rather than a substantive commentary on biotechnology or scientific advancement.

## 2. HISTORY
Based on the article's content, there are no material developments to track or assess after publication. The post is a casual, snow-day blog entry reflecting on weather events and does not present any claims, initiatives, or research directions that could be followed up. No concrete impacts on drug approvals, therapeutic pipelines, policy changes, or business outcomes stem from this piece, nor was any intended. The post remains a vignette about temporary lab closures during a 2013 Northeastern snowstorm, with no subsequent scientific or business consequences identified.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article did not include substantive predictions about biotechnology, healthcare, business outcomes, or policy. The playful comment that "Research will be slow today" was immediately descriptive of the snow day rather than a medium- or long-term forecast. No other predictions appear in the text.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **0/10**

The article is off-topic for the requested analysis: it does not meaningfully discuss biotechnology, scientific progress, or developments in the life sciences, instead serving as a brief personal weather commentary. It lacks concrete claims or evidence that would enable a benefit-of-hindsight review as an expert in science and biotechnology.
