# More Industrial Espionage (February 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY
This brief 2012 blog post from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" column reports on federal charges alleging Chinese government involvement in the theft of DuPont's titanium dioxide manufacturing technology. The article references a Chemical & Engineering News piece documenting that prosecutors had filed charges on January 31, 2012, in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Walter Liew. According to court documents, FBI officials found letters during a search of Liew's home indicating that he "was tasked by representatives of the People's Republic of China government to obtain technology used to build chloride-route titanium dioxide factories." The post positions this incident as part of ongoing concerns about industrial espionage, referencing previous December 2011 discussions about Chinese pharmaceutical espionage, and concludes with a note that more details would follow as the case developed.

## 2. HISTORY
The Walter Liew case evolved significantly after this February 2012 report. In August 2014, Liew was convicted by a federal jury in San Francisco on charges of economic espionage, trade secret theft, and conspiracy. The prosecution's case established that Liew had received assignments from Chinese government officials to steal DuPont's proprietary chloride-route titanium dioxide manufacturing process—a cleaner and more efficient method than the traditional sulfate process.

The case revealed that Liew had been paid millions of dollars by Chinese state-owned enterprises, particularly Pangang Group, to acquire and transfer this technology. The stolen secrets enabled Chinese companies to build titanium dioxide production facilities without the substantial research and development costs DuPont had incurred.

In September 2014, Liew was sentenced to 15 years in prison and ordered to pay $28 million in restitution to DuPont. His wife and business partner, Christina Liew, was also convicted and sentenced to time served. The case marked one of the first successful prosecutions under the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 involving direct foreign government involvement.

Concrete implications included: DuPont's competitive advantage in titanium dioxide manufacturing was compromised, Chinese producers gained access to advanced chloride-route technology that would have otherwise required significant investment to develop independently, and the case set legal precedent for prosecuting economic espionage cases involving state actors. The prosecution also highlighted the growing threat of state-sponsored industrial espionage targeting U.S. technology companies.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The original article did not contain explicit predictions about future developments. The author simply noted "More on this as it develops" without speculating on outcomes.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **7/10**
This article documenting early reporting on the Liew case represents an important real-world example of state-sponsored economic espionage that resulted in successful prosecution and significant legal precedent.

**Note:** The case discussed in this article ultimately culminated in one of the most significant economic espionage prosecutions in U.S. history, with Walter Liew receiving a 15-year prison sentence in 2014 for stealing and transferring DuPont's titanium dioxide manufacturing technology to Chinese state-owned enterprises. The prosecution successfully demonstrated direct Chinese government involvement in the theft scheme, marking an important legal milestone in addressing state-sponsored industrial espionage.
