# How Much Is Wrong? (January 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary article from Derek Lowe's "In the Pipeline" blog discusses Jeff Leek's statistical perspective on the reproducibility crisis in scientific research. The article centers on the debate about how much published research findings are false. Leek, a statistician, takes a more measured approach by dismissing the widely-cited Amgen paper on drug target reproducibility issues as "not a scientific paper" and criticizing Ioannidis' seminal PLoS Medicine paper as being based on "conjecture and simulation" rather than real data. Leek favors the Many Labs project for its mathematical rigor, though this focused on experimental psychology rather than biological or chemical research.

Lowe expresses skepticism about Leek's sanguine view, arguing that while reports from Amgen and Bayer/Schering about reproducibility problems may be "semi-anecdotal," the consistent direction of these findings across multiple sources is concerning. Lowe also worries that lumping all scientific fields together as "Science" obscures important differences—what applies to experimental psychology may not reflect the situation in chemistry and biology.

## 2. HISTORY

The reproducibility crisis debate that this article discusses escalated significantly in subsequent years, leading to concrete changes in scientific practice and substantial real-world impact:

**Replication Efforts and Outcomes (2014-2020):**
- The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology (launched 2013, results published 2017-2021) found that only about 50% of landmark cancer biology studies could be replicated, with replication success correlating with effect sizes and journal prestige.
- The Center for Open Science's large-scale replication attempts in psychology confirmed that many classic findings did not replicate, leading to changes in research methodology standards.
- In drug development specifically, later studies continued to show that 50-70% of published preclinical studies could not be replicated by industry labs.

**Impact on Pharmaceutical Industry:**
The awareness of reproducibility issues led to significant operational changes:
- Major pharmaceutical companies implemented more rigorous internal validation protocols before pursuing external academic findings
- Reduced reliance on single academic papers for target validation decisions
- Increased investment in in-house replication studies before committing to drug development programs
- Industry-academic partnerships evolved to include mandatory validation milestones

**Policy and Institutional Changes:**
Many scientific journals and funding agencies introduced new requirements:
- The NIH implemented rigor and reproducibility requirements in grant applications (2015-2020)
- Journals began requiring detailed methods, statistical checklists, and data availability
- Pre-registration of studies became more common in clinical research

**Business Impact:**
Companies that specialized in research validation and reproducibility services emerged and grew during this period. However, the "cost of bad research" became increasingly visible in pharmaceutical R&D budgets, with companies reporting that unreproducible findings contributed to drug candidate failures in early development stages.

The field continued grappling with these issues without reaching consensus on exact percentages of false findings, but the scientific community largely accepted that reproducibility problems were real and significant.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

The article does not contain explicit predictions about the future, but several implicit expectations can be inferred:

**Found:** No explicit predictions were made in the article. The piece is primarily analytical rather than predictive, focusing on the ongoing debate about research reproducibility without forecasting specific outcomes.

**Implicit expectations:**
- That the debate between statistical purists and empirical researchers would continue
- That reproducibility challenges varied significantly between scientific fields
- That industrial research (pharmaceutical and biotechnology) would face continued challenges validating published academic research

**Actual outcomes:**
- The reproducibility debate intensified rather than subsided
- Field-specific differences in reproducibility issues became better documented
- Pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries did indeed continue struggling with reproducibility, leading to significant operational changes in how they evaluate external research

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article represents an early and insightful commentary on a debate that grew into a major scientific reform movement. Its recognition that different scientific fields face different reproducibility challenges and its nuanced position between statistical purism and empirical concern proved prescient. The piece captures a transitional moment when the scientific community was beginning to seriously confront reproducibility issues in a systematic way.
