# Publishing, Perishing, Buying and Selling (September 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The Guardian commentary laments the way academic success is measured by sheer publication counts and journal impact factors. It cites an Imperial College medicine department target that demanded three papers a year, one in a journal with an impact factor ≥ 5, arguing that such quotas degrade scientific quality and demoralise researchers. The author contrasts academia with industry, where the “real” metric is whether a drug can be sold and generate revenue. The piece concludes that the publishing industry is the primary beneficiary of the “publish‑or‑perish” culture.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Re‑evaluation of impact factors and metrics (2012‑2026)**  
* **DORA (Declaration on Research Assessment, 2012)** – Over 2,000 institutions and funders signed, urging the abandonment of journal‑based metrics for hiring, promotion, and funding decisions. Many universities (e.g., University of California system, UCL) have since removed impact‑factor criteria from internal assessments.  
* **Plan S (2020)** – European funders mandated immediate open‑access publishing for funded research, shifting some revenue from subscription publishers to article‑processing charges (APCs). This reduced the monopoly of high‑impact journals but also introduced new pressures (high APCs, “gold” open‑access prestige).  
* **Preprint explosion** – bioRxiv (launched 2013) and medRxiv (2019) grew to host > 200,000 life‑science preprints by 2025, providing a venue for rapid dissemination without journal impact‑factor constraints.  

**Changes in academic hiring and evaluation**  
* **Metric‑free or metric‑light hiring panels** have become common in the UK (RIU 2021) and the US (NIH 2022). However, many departments still informally reference impact factors, especially in competitive fields like biotechnology.  
* **Altmetrics and narrative CVs** (adopted by the European Research Council in 2023) allow researchers to showcase software, data sets, patents, and industry collaborations, partially addressing the “publish‑or‑perish” critique.  

**Industry‑academia interface**  
* **Biotech start‑ups** increasingly recruit PhDs with strong translational track records (e.g., patents, clinical‑stage projects) rather than high publication counts.  
* **Collaborative funding models** (e.g., CARB‑X, 2021) blend academic discovery with industry milestones, tying researcher incentives to product‑oriented outcomes.  

**Publishing industry outcomes**  
* **Consolidation** – The “big five” (Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley, Taylor & Francis, and Wiley) still dominate, but their revenue growth slowed after 2018 as institutions negotiated “read‑and‑publish” deals.  
* **Rise of “prestige‑free” journals** – PLOS Biology, eLife, and the newly launched “Science Advances” (2020) have achieved high citation rates without traditional impact‑factor branding, showing that quality can be decoupled from legacy metrics.  

Overall, the pressure to publish has not disappeared, but the ecosystem has diversified: impact factors are less decisive for funding and hiring, open‑access mandates and preprints have broadened dissemination, and industry now values translational outputs alongside papers.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
| Prediction from the article (or implied) | What actually happened | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **“Only the publishing industry benefits from the intense pressure to publish.”** | Publishing houses retained profit, but the rise of APC‑based open‑access models shifted some revenue to authors/institutions. Moreover, many researchers (especially early‑career) experienced burnout, confirming the negative side‑effects. | Partially true – publishers still profit, but new models have redistributed some benefits. |
| **“Pressure to publish reduces the quality of science.”** | Studies (e.g., *Nature* 2020 meta‑analysis) show a modest increase in retraction rates and reproducibility concerns, but the proliferation of preprints and post‑publication peer review has mitigated some quality loss. | Largely true, though the ecosystem now includes corrective mechanisms. |
| **Implicit: Academic targets (e.g., “three papers per year, one with IF ≥ 5”) are counter‑productive.** | Institutions that removed such quotas (e.g., University of Cambridge 2018) reported steadier or improved research quality metrics, while those retaining strict quotas still face criticism. | Confirmed – quota‑driven policies are widely viewed as harmful. |
| **Contrast with industry: “The only real metric is a drug people will pay for.”** | Biotech firms continue to prioritize marketable products; however, many now also value “platform” technologies and data assets, not just FDA‑approved drugs. | Generally accurate, though the definition of “product” has broadened. |

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 7/10** – The piece captures a persistent cultural tension in science that has spurred concrete reforms (DORA, Plan S, preprints). Its critique remains relevant, though the article’s tone is polemical rather than analytical, limiting its depth.
