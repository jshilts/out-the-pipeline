# The Clinic Giveth And Most Definitely Taketh Away (February 2019)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary reviews several dramatic clinical trial results announced around February 2019, illustrating the binary nature of drug development outcomes. On the positive side, MacroGenics (not "MacroGenix" as written) reported that their Fc-optimized HER2 antibody margetuximab achieved statistical significance versus Herceptin in a Phase III trial for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer, causing the company's stock to more than double, though overall survival data was not yet available. On the negative side, Solid Biosciences disclosed that their Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene therapy (SGT-001) failed to produce meaningful dystrophin expression in initial patient biopsies, leading to a 70% stock drop, while Eli Lilly's Phase III trial of Lartruvo (olaratumab) for soft tissue sarcoma—previously granted accelerated approval based on promising Phase II survival data—failed to show any overall survival benefit versus chemotherapy alone, jeopardizing a drug that had generated over $200 million in revenue. The article also notes disappointing early zinc-finger gene editing results from Sangamo Therapeutics, with low target gene expression and immune responses observed. The author emphasizes that all three cases highlight the critical need for more data and mechanistic understanding in biotechnology development.

## 2. HISTORY

**Macrogenics/Margetuximab:** The drug referenced here is margetuximab, MacroGenics' Fc-optimized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody. In December 2020, the FDA approved margetuximab-cmkb (MARGENZA) in combination with chemotherapy for adults with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 regimens, based on the SOPHIA Phase III trial that showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival compared to trastuzumab (Herceptin) plus chemotherapy. However, the overall survival benefit was modest—margetuximab showed a 1.8-month improvement (median 21.6 vs 19.8 months, hazard ratio 0.89), which did not reach statistical significance. The drug achieved approval but has not substantially displaced trastuzumab or other HER2 therapies in clinical practice, and market uptake has been limited compared to blockbuster expectations.

**Solid Biosciences/SGT-001:** Solid's Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene therapy program (SGT-001) continued to face significant challenges after February 2019. The company struggled with manufacturing issues and continued to report inconsistent and generally low levels of micro-dystrophin expression in clinical trials. The program experienced multiple clinical holds and modifications to the trial design. By 2020-2022, Solid had shifted some focus toward other candidates but continued SGT-001 development at reduced scale. The field of Duchenne gene therapy has seen more success with competitors—notably Sarepta Therapeutics' Elevidys (delandistrogene moxeparvovec), which received accelerated FDA approval in June 2023 despite mixed efficacy data, representing the first gene therapy approved for Duchenne. Solid's program remains in development but has not achieved breakthrough efficacy.

**Eli Lilly/Lartruvo (olaratumab):** Following the negative Phase III ANNOUNCE trial results reported in early 2019, Eli Lilly voluntarily withdrew olaratumab from the market for soft tissue sarcoma in April 2019 after consulting with the FDA and EMA. The company discontinued all promotional activities and worked with regulatory agencies to remove the drug from treatment guidelines. Lilly recorded significant charges related to the withdrawal and wrote down the asset value. The PDGFR-α pathway that olaratumab targeted has not emerged as a successful therapeutic target in oncology despite mechanistic rationale, and no subsequent drugs targeting this pathway have achieved major success in sarcoma or other solid tumors.

**Sangamo Therapeutics:** Sangamo continued developing zinc-finger nuclease gene-editing therapies, including SB-318 (for MPS I) and SB-913 (for MPS II), but reported limited clinical efficacy with transient and low-level protein expression. The company struggled with delivery challenges and variable patient responses, and its stock declined substantially from 2019 highs. In 2020-2022, Sangamo shifted focus toward partnerships and new platforms while de-emphasizing the initial zinc-finger programs that showed disappointing results.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Macrogenics antibody approval despite missing OS data:** The author noted investors hoped for FDA approval before overall survival data readout. **Outcome:** The FDA did approve margetuximab in December 2020 based primarily on progression-free survival, which validated the suggested regulatory path, but the eventual modest OS benefit highlighted the wisdom of requiring mature survival data.

• **Solid Bio's gene therapy facing fundamental expression challenges:** The author observed that low protein expression reflects broader gene therapy limitations in humans. **Outcome:** This proved prescient—Solid continued struggling with expression levels and manufacturing while the broader Duchenne gene therapy field achieved only limited success, with the first approved therapy (Elevidys) showing controversial efficacy. The fundamental delivery and expression challenges in gene therapy remain largely unresolved.

• **Accelerated approval policies:** The author suggested accelerated approval was appropriate while noting these represent "chances" rather than certainties. **Outcome:** The Lartruvo withdrawal (along with other high-profile accelerated approval withdrawals in subsequent years) fueled ongoing policy debates about accelerated pathways, leading to increased FDA scrutiny and requirements for more robust confirmatory trial designs, though the fundamental accelerated approval framework remains intact.

• **Gene-editing platform maturity:** The author questioned whether gene-editing pessimism was justified or just reality correction. **Outcome:** This perspective proved insightful—while gene-editing platforms have advanced (CRISPR-based therapies now approved for sickle cell disease), the technical challenges of in vivo delivery, precise editing efficiency, and avoiding immune responses remain substantial, and the field has consolidated around fewer viable approaches than initially anticipated.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **6/10**

This article captures an important moment illustrating the high-risk nature of biotechnology development and the paradox that Phase II success often fails to predict Phase III outcomes, but the specific cases discussed had mixed ultimate importance—two program failures and one qualified approval with limited clinical impact.
