# Chemists and Biologists, In Detail (May 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author observes a cultural gap between chemists and biologists in how experimental details are communicated. In mixed‑discipline talks, biologists tend to enumerate every buffer composition, column brand, and blot image, whereas chemists usually give a high‑level description of reagents and reaction types, leaving the gritty specifics (TLC plates, LC‑MS traces, NMR spectra) to supplemental material or personal notebooks. The piece argues that biology’s inherent complexity forces more exhaustive reporting, while organic synthesis is perceived as more reproducible and therefore “detail‑light.” The author also jokes that chemists will soon need a new excuse for omitting data as LC‑MS becomes the dominant analytical tool.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Reproducibility and reporting standards** – Over the past decade the “reproducibility crisis” has been discussed in both biology and chemistry. Major journals (e.g., *Nature*, *Science*, *JACS*, *Angewandte*) now require detailed methods sections, raw data deposition, and, increasingly, electronic supplementary information that includes NMR spectra, LC‑MS chromatograms, and even raw instrument files. This trend narrows the gap the author described.

**LC‑MS ubiquity** – LC‑MS has indeed become a routine workhorse in synthetic chemistry, especially for rapid reaction monitoring and purity assessment of drug‑like molecules. Most synthetic papers now include at least one LC‑MS trace in the supporting information, and many journals mandate it for new compounds. However, the practice of showing full chromatograms in oral presentations remains uncommon; presenters still rely on summary data (e.g., purity percentages) unless the audience specifically requests raw traces.

**Open‑science tools** – The rise of electronic lab notebooks (ELNs), FAIR data principles, and repositories such as ChemRxiv, Figshare, and the Open Science Framework has made detailed experimental metadata more accessible across disciplines. Biologists have adopted similar practices (e.g., depositing raw gel images, sequencing files) and now often share protocols on platforms like Protocols.io.

**Cross‑disciplinary training** – Graduate programs and workshops (e.g., NIH’s “Reproducibility and Rigor” courses, ACS’s “Chemistry for Biologists” seminars) have emphasized the importance of transparent reporting regardless of field. As a result, many chemists now routinely list column dimensions, solvent gradients, and catalyst loadings in talks, especially when addressing mixed audiences.

**Business and policy impact** – Pharmaceutical companies have internal standards that require full analytical documentation for any candidate entering pre‑clinical development. Regulatory agencies (FDA, EMA) have tightened expectations for method validation, pushing both chemists and biologists toward more granular reporting.

Overall, the cultural distinction highlighted in 2012 has softened: both communities now recognize that detailed methodological disclosure is essential for reproducibility, though the depth of detail still varies with the venue and audience.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  

- **Prediction:** *“We’ll need a new line as LC/MS takes over the world.”*  
  **Outcome:** Accurate. LC‑MS is now standard in synthetic labs, and most synthetic publications include LC‑MS data. The “new line” has become “please see the supporting information for LC‑MS traces,” rather than an excuse to omit them.

- **Prediction:** *Biology will continue to require exhaustive detail because of hidden variables.*  
  **Outcome:** Partially true. While detailed reporting remains common, the field has moved toward standardized reagents (e.g., CRISPR kits, commercial antibodies with batch numbers) and community‑agreed protocols, reducing some of the “hidden variables.” Nonetheless, many biology talks still feature extensive buffer recipes and gel images.

- **Implicit prediction:** *Chemists are comfortable with high‑level descriptions and rarely show raw analytical data.*  
  **Outcome:** Overly optimistic. Modern chemistry conferences increasingly feature “data‑rich” posters and talks, especially in drug discovery, where raw LC‑MS, NMR, and even raw mass‑spectra are displayed to satisfy regulatory and collaborative partners.

- **Implicit prediction:** *The reproducibility gap between the fields is large.*  
  **Outcome:** The gap has narrowed. Both fields now face similar pressures from journals, funders, and industry to provide complete methodological transparency.

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **6/10**  
The piece captures a genuine cultural observation that sparked discussion about reproducibility, and its themes remain relevant, but the article itself is anecdotal and lacks concrete data, limiting its long‑term scholarly impact.
