# The Papers In This Journal Are Just So Darn Relevant (July 2012)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The author uses a sarcastic tone to criticize the over‑reliance on journal impact factors, especially the way Thomson Reuters (now Clarivate) markets them as a definitive measure of quality. He points out that in 2012 a record number of journals were stripped of their impact‑factor listings because they had inflated the metric through excessive self‑citations. One of the censured journals had previously been highlighted by Thomson Reuters as a “Rising Star,” underscoring the perverse incentives created by the impact‑factor system. The piece also mentions a “citation cartel” in which a small group of journals deliberately cited each other to boost their scores, and the author invites readers to flag any similar behaviour in chemistry journals.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2012 developments in impact‑factor governance**  

* **Continued suppression of journals** – Clarivate (which took over the JCR from Thomson Reuters in 2016) has repeatedly removed journals from the Impact Factor list for anomalous citation patterns. In 2019, 33 journals were suppressed for excessive self‑citation; similar actions occurred in 2020 and 2022. The practice of flagging “citation cartels” became a regular part of the JCR quality‑control workflow.  

* **New metrics and transparency** – In 2020 Clarivate introduced the *Journal Citation Indicator* (JCI) and highlighted *Eigenfactor* and *Article Influence* scores alongside the traditional Impact Factor. These metrics are less sensitive to self‑citation, reflecting the industry’s response to the criticisms raised in the 2012 article.  

* **Broader push against impact‑factor dominance** – The San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), released in 2012, gained traction over the following decade. By 2023, more than 20 000 institutions, funders, and publishers had signed DORA, explicitly committing to evaluate research on its own merits rather than on the journal’s Impact Factor. Several major funding agencies (e.g., the European Research Council, the NIH) have updated their guidelines to de‑emphasize Impact Factors.  

* **Empirical studies of citation cartels** – Academic investigations published in 2018‑2021 (e.g., a PNAS paper on “Citation Cartels in Scientific Publishing”) confirmed that coordinated self‑citation schemes exist across many disciplines, including chemistry. These studies used network‑analysis methods to identify clusters of journals that disproportionately cite each other, validating the author’s anecdotal concern.  

* **Shift toward alternative metrics** – Altmetric scores, usage statistics, and open‑access compliance metrics have become commonplace in journal dashboards. While Impact Factors remain a headline figure, their monopoly over research assessment has eroded, aligning with the article’s warning that the metric was being “gilded” by marketing.  

* **Business impact** – Publishers that relied heavily on Impact Factor promotion (e.g., some mid‑tier Elsevier and Springer Nature titles) have diversified their marketing to highlight article‑level metrics and open‑access options. No major chemistry journal was ever placed on the 2012 “banned” list, and the field has not seen a systemic rise of citation cartels comparable to the case the author described.  

**Overall**, the concerns voiced in 2012 anticipated a decade of increased scrutiny, the introduction of complementary metrics, and a cultural shift away from treating the Impact Factor as the sole proxy for quality.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article did not contain explicit forecasts, but it implied several expectations:

| Implied prediction | What actually happened |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| **Self‑citation manipulation would be exposed and penalised** | Confirmed. Clarivate has repeatedly suppressed journals for excessive self‑citations (2019, 2020, 2022). |
| **Citation cartels would be identified and called out** | Confirmed. Scholarly analyses (2018‑2021) documented coordinated citation rings in multiple fields, including chemistry. |
| **Impact‑factor hype would be challenged by the research community** | Confirmed. DORA and numerous institutional policies have explicitly de‑emphasised Impact Factors. |
| **Journals would lose credibility if caught in citation gaming** | Confirmed. Suppressed journals lose their Impact Factor, which often leads to reduced submissions and lower prestige. |
| **The “Rising Star” profiling would be unreliable** | Partially confirmed. While Clarivate still highlights emerging journals, the practice is now accompanied by stricter citation‑pattern monitoring, reducing the chance of false elevation. |

## 4. INTEREST  
Rating: **7/10**  
The article is a concise, prescient critique of a metric that continues to shape publishing incentives; its relevance has only grown as the community grapples with impact‑factor misuse and seeks more robust assessment tools.
