# Man, That's A Lot of New Public Companies (October 2013)

## 1. SUMMARY

This brief commentary from 2013 observes the remarkably high pace of biotech initial public offerings, noting that thirty-eight companies had already gone public by early October. The author highlights the recent Fate Therapeutics IPO as having underwhelmed and questions whether the biotech IPO boom may be nearing its end. The piece frames the situation through the metaphor of musical chairs, wondering when the "music has to stop" and whether investors should continue participating in this wave of new offerings throughout what historically had been a favorable month for stock activity.

## 2. HISTORY

The 2013-2015 period marked one of the most significant biotech IPO boom cycles in history. What the author observed as thirty-eight IPOs by early October ultimately grew substantially, with the full year 2013 seeing over fifty biotech IPOs—numbers not seen since the late 1990s biotech bubble.

This trend accelerated further in 2014, which became a record-breaking year with even more biotech companies going public. The boom continued into early 2015 before experiencing a notable slowdown. Several factors drove this cycle: low interest rates making yield-seeking capital abundant, breakthrough drug approvals generating optimism, and the JOBS Act of 2012 making it easier for emerging growth companies to go public.

Regarding Fate Therapeutics specifically, the company remained public and went on to advance its cell therapy programs, though like many development-stage biotechs, it experienced the typical volatility of clinical-stage drug development cycles.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Prediction**: The article questions if the Fate Therapeutics IPO disappointment signals that "the music has to stop" for the biotech IPO wave.

• **Outcome**: The boom actually intensified in the short term, with 2014 becoming an even stronger year for biotech IPOs. The slowdown the author anticipated came later, primarily in 2015-2016.

• **Prediction**: Implicit concern about investor appetite for additional IPOs (questioning enthusiasm for the 39th or 47th IPO).

• **Outcome**: Investor appetite remained robust through most of 2014, though ultimately the author's caution proved prescient—just delayed by about 1-2 years. The biotech sector did experience a significant downturn starting in 2015-2016.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **4/10**

This commentary captures a real turning-point moment but lacks the specificity needed for higher impact.
