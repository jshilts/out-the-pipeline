# Jailhouse Secrets They Don't Want You to Know About! (March 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY

This article reported that Kevin Trudeau, a notorious infomercial personality and author of "natural cure" books, was sentenced to a ten-year prison term for criminal contempt. The author expressed satisfaction with this outcome, noting that Trudeau had repeatedly violated court orders prohibiting him from continuing his fraudulent marketing practices. The piece characterized Trudeau's business model as exploiting public ignorance about science and medicine by promoting conspiracy theories about hidden natural remedies that "they" supposedly didn't want people to discover. While celebrating Trudeau's conviction, the author pessimistically predicted that similar fraudulent health schemes would likely continue to emerge.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2014 conviction, Kevin Trudeau did indeed serve time in federal prison, though his sentence was ultimately shortened. He was released in early 2020. The criminal contempt conviction stemmed from his violation of a 2004 FTC settlement that banned him from making false claims about healthcare products. Trudeau had continued promoting his book series "Natural Cures 'They' Don't Want You to Know About" through infomercials despite the court order. The FTC successfully argued that despite presenting the books as containing health information rather than product endorsements, Trudeau was still engaged in deceptive marketing practices that violated his earlier consent decree. Public policy around health fraud enforcement has remained relatively constant since this case, with the FTC continuing to pursue similar cases when they reach sufficient scale to warrant federal attention.  

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **That Trudeau would serve his sentence**: True - he did serve time, though released early in 2020 rather than serving the full ten years.
• **That his infomercial vehicle would be cleaned and "fit to transport honest burglars again"**: No way to evaluate this whimsical metaphor about prison transport vehicles.
• **"With any luck, we shall not see his like again"**: Turned out to be overly optimistic. The health fraud and misinformation landscape has arguably worsened since 2014, with social media platforms amplifying alternative medicine claims, anti-vaccine content, and unproven health remedies far beyond what 20th-century infomercial technology could achieve.
• **"But I'm afraid we will"**: This pessimistic prediction proved accurate. Notable examples include Alex Jones's promotion of various supplements on his platforms, the continued proliferation of unsubstantiated alternative cancer treatments, and more recently, various unproven COVID-19 treatments and misinformation that emerged during the pandemic.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **3/10**

This article represents a routine commentary on a known fraudster's conviction. While Trudeau's case was significant for being one of the more visible health fraud prosecutions, the article itself doesn't present novel insights about biotechnology or scientific advancement, instead focusing on well-established fraudulent practices that predate and postdate this particular case.
