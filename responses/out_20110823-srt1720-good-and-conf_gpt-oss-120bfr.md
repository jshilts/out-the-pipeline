# SRT1720: Good (And Confusing) News for Obese Mice (August 2011)

## 1. SUMMARY  
The blog post reviews a 2011 *Scientific Reports* paper that claimed the small‑molecule SRT1720 extended both lifespan and healthspan in male mice fed a high‑fat diet. Two doses (30 mg kg⁻¹ and 100 mg kg⁻¹) were mixed into chow; the higher dose raised median survival from 94 weeks (high‑fat control) to 115 weeks, almost matching the 125‑week median of mice on a standard diet. The authors reported reversal of typical diet‑induced pathologies—hepatic steatosis, pancreatic β‑cell hyperplasia, hyperinsulinemia, inflammatory markers, and DNA damage—without obvious toxicity, even after >80 weeks of treatment.  

The post places this result in the context of a heated controversy over SRT1720 and other “sirtuin activators.” Earlier studies (2007–2010) had both supported SRT1720 as a SIRT1 activator that improved metabolic phenotypes and, conversely, questioned its in‑vitro assay validity (fluorescent‑peptide artifacts) and in‑vivo efficacy (reports of toxicity and lack of benefit). The author notes the contradictory literature, the difficulty of reconciling the new positive mouse data with prior negative findings, and the practical concern that the effective doses are far higher than would be feasible in humans.

## 2. HISTORY  
**Post‑2011 development of SRT1720 and the Sirtris/GSK sirtuin program**

| Year | Key events |
|------|------------|
| **2011‑2012** | GSK continued pre‑clinical work on SRT1720 and related compounds, but no human trials were initiated. |
| **2013** | GSK announced the termination of its Sirtris sirtuin‑activator program. The company cited “insufficient differentiation from existing therapies” and the growing consensus that the original SIRT1‑activation assays were flawed. |
| **2014‑2015** | Independent groups published additional mechanistic studies showing that SRT1720’s metabolic effects were largely **off‑target**, likely involving inhibition of phosphodiesterases and other enzymes rather than direct SIRT1 activation. |
| **2016‑2020** | The broader “sirtuin‑activator” field shifted focus to **NAD⁺ precursors** (nicotinamide riboside, NMN) and to more selective SIRT1 modulators that avoided the assay artifacts that plagued the original Sirtris chemistry. No SRT1720‑derived drug entered clinical development. |
| **2021‑2024** | SRT1720 is occasionally used as a **research tool** to probe metabolic pathways, but most publications treat it as a **non‑specific compound** and caution against interpreting results as proof of SIRT1 activation. |
| **2025** | GSK’s internal archives (released in a corporate history) confirm that SRT1720 never progressed beyond animal studies and that the program’s budget was re‑allocated to other epigenetic targets. |

**Clinical and commercial outcome**  
- **No FDA‑approved drug** derived from SRT1720 or its close analogues.  
- **No large‑scale human trials** were ever launched; the highest‑dose mouse regimen (≈100 mg kg⁻¹) would translate to an impractically large human dose (>7 g per day) given the compound’s pharmacokinetics.  
- The **commercial value** of the Sirtris acquisition (≈$720 M) was later written down, reflecting the failure to deliver a marketable product.

**Impact on the field**  
- The controversy surrounding SRT1720 helped **expose weaknesses** in early sirtuin‑activator assays, prompting the development of more rigorous biochemical screens.  
- It also contributed to a **skeptical view** of “miracle‑molecule” claims in metabolic aging, influencing funding agencies to demand stronger mechanistic validation.  
- The episode is frequently cited in reviews of **failed drug‑discovery programs**, serving as a cautionary case study rather than a scientific breakthrough.

## 3. PREDICTIONS  
The article itself did not list explicit bullet‑point predictions, but it implied several expectations:

- **Prediction:** *SRT1720 could be developed into a therapeutic that improves healthspan in obese humans.*  
  **Outcome:** No human trials; the required doses are pharmacologically unrealistic. The compound never entered the clinic, and no SRT1720‑based drug exists.

- **Prediction:** *High‑dose, long‑term administration would be safe.*  
  **Outcome:** Early reports (Pacholec et al., 2010) described toxicity at 100 mg kg⁻¹; later GSK data showed tolerability in mice, but the consensus is that the safety profile is unclear and the doses are not translatable to humans.

- **Prediction:** *The beneficial effects observed in mice would be reproducible across species (e.g., nematodes, other rodent models).*  
  **Outcome:** Subsequent studies failed to reproduce lifespan extension in *C. elegans* and showed mixed results in other mouse models. The metabolic improvements were later attributed to off‑target actions rather than genuine SIRT1 activation.

- **Prediction (implicit):** *The controversy over assay artifacts would be resolved, confirming SRT1720 as a true SIRT1 activator.*  
  **Outcome:** The assay artifacts were confirmed; the field now regards SRT1720 as a **non‑specific** compound, and the original claim of direct SIRT1 activation is largely discredited.

## 4. INTEREST  
**Rating: 6/10** – The article captures a pivotal moment in the sirtuin‑activator saga, illustrating how early enthusiasm can clash with methodological flaws. Its historical relevance to drug‑discovery lessons is notable, though the specific compound never achieved clinical impact.
