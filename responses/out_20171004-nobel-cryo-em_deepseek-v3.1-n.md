# A Nobel for Cryo-EM (October 2017)

## 1. SUMMARY

The article discusses the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry awarded for cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to Richard Henderson, Jacques Dubochet, and Joachim Frank. The author explains that this recognition was somewhat surprising only because the Nobel committee typically waits longer before awarding prizes, not because the achievement wasn't worthy. The piece provides historical context about the dominance of X-ray crystallography in structural biology, which requires growing high-quality crystals—a process described as "brutally empirical voodoo" that is extremely difficult or impossible for many important biomolecules, particularly membrane proteins. The three laureates contributed complementary breakthroughs: Henderson pioneered atomic-resolution protein structure determination using electron microscopy; Dubochet developed vitrification techniques to preserve proteins in glassy ice rather than crystalline ice; and Frank created computational methods to reconstruct 3D structures from the random orientations of individual protein molecules in frozen samples.

## 2. HISTORY

Following the 2017 Nobel Prize, cryo-EM experienced explosive growth and became a standard technique in structural biology. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) saw a dramatic shift: while X-ray crystallography structures previously dominated, cryo-EM depositions increased from approximately 5% of annual structures in 2016 to over 30% by 2023. Major structural biology facilities worldwide invested heavily in cryo-EM infrastructure, with high-end Titan Krios microscopes becoming standard equipment at research institutions.

The most significant impact was on membrane protein structural biology. Prior to the widespread adoption of cryo-EM, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other membrane proteins were notoriously difficult to crystallize. Post-2017, cryo-EM enabled determination of numerous previously intractable membrane protein structures, directly impacting drug discovery pipelines. Pharmaceutical companies integrated cryo-EM into their structure-based drug design workflows, particularly for challenging targets like ion channels and transporters.

Several drug discovery success stories emerged. For example, structural work on the SGLT2 receptor using cryo-EM improved understanding of diabetes drugs like canagliflozin, though this built on earlier work. More directly, detailed cryo-EM structures of viral proteins contributed to COVID-19 therapeutic development, including structural characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Academic and industrial groups routinely used cryo-EM for structure-based vaccine design.

The technology improved significantly after 2017. Direct electron detectors became standard, motion correction algorithms improved, and automation made high-resolution structure determination more routine. Resolution improved from the 3-4 Å range considered good in 2017 to routine sub-3 Å and frequent sub-2 Å structures by 2023. These advances made cryo-EM competitive with or superior to crystallography for many applications.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

**Prediction**: The article predicted that cryo-EM would continue advancing rapidly and that "every research program around the world with an interest in structural biology" would pay close attention to the field.

**Outcome**: This proved accurate. Cryo-EM became a standard technique in structural biology labs globally, with facilities at essentially every major research university and pharmaceutical company by 2020-2022. The technique moved from niche to mainstream faster than even optimistic observers expected.

**Prediction**: The author described how getting protein structures without crystallization would be "wildly appealing to structural biologists."

**Outcome**: This appeal translated into rapid adoption, particularly for complexes that resisted crystallization, including spliceosomes, ribosomes, membrane proteins, and large molecular machines. However, it didn't completely replace crystallography—it complemented it, expanding the toolkit.

**Prediction**: The title's focus on the Nobel award itself was not explicitly predictive, but it suggested the technique had reached maturity worthy of ultimate scientific recognition.

**Outcome**: The timing was prescient—the Nobel came at the beginning of cryo-EM's most productive period. The statement "The Nobel for it is certainly deserved" was validated by the subsequent explosion in capability and adoption.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **8/10**

This article captures a pivotal moment when a transformative technique reached Nobel recognition and mainstream acceptance. The accuracy of the enthusiastic assessment, combined with the technique's subsequent impact on drug discovery and fundamental biology, makes it a valuable historical document about technological inflection points in biological research.
