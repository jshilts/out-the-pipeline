# Bigger and Greasier (14 Feb 2005)

## 1. SUMMARY

This commentary discusses the "Rule of Five" developed by Chris Lipinski and colleagues at Pfizer, which are heuristics for predicting oral bioavailability based on four molecular properties: fewer than five hydrogen-bond donors, molecular weight under 500, logP under 5, and fewer than ten hydrogen-bond acceptors. The article references a follow-up analysis by John Proudfoot at Boehringer Ingelheim published in Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters (2005) showing similar patterns across a broader dataset, with potential refinement to molecular weight 470 and three hydrogen-bond donors. The author notes the statistic that most drugs don't violate multiple rules simultaneously. The article observes that molecular weights of drugs have trended upward from under 300 in the 1930s to approaching 500 by 1997. The author emphasizes the rules as practical filters for large compound libraries rather than absolute prohibitions, criticizing when the rules are applied dogmatically to compounds already demonstrating good in vivo oral efficacy.

## 2. HISTORY

**Advancements in drug properties**: In the two decades since 2005, pharmaceutical research has seen continued evolution beyond strict Rule of Five thresholds. By the late 2000s and 2010s, the pharmaceutical industry increasingly recognized the importance of more nuanced metrics. The concept of "beyond Rule of Five" (bRo5) space gained prominence, particularly as research shifted toward more challenging targets including protein-protein interactions, intracellular targets, and CNS penetration requiring specific physicochemical profiles.

**Methodology refinement**: Research into oral bioavailability expanded beyond Lipinski's rules to include other calculated properties and experimental measures. Scientists developed more sophisticated ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity) prediction models, and the use of calculated properties like polar surface area (PSA), rotatable bonds, and aromatic rings became widespread. The development of high-throughput ADMET screening in the 2000s and 2010s allowed experimental evaluation earlier in drug discovery, reducing reliance on computational filters alone.

**Industry practice evolution**: Drug discovery practice increasingly balanced empirical data with computational predictions. By the 2010s, many pharmaceutical companies incorporated broader property spaces while maintaining awareness of increased risk with bRo5 compounds. Techniques like formulation development, prodrug strategies, and advanced delivery methods helped address bioavailability challenges for compounds outside traditional drug-like space. Regulatory agencies like the FDA increasingly accepted non-traditional drug molecules as understanding of oral absorption mechanisms matured.

## 3. PREDICTIONS

• **Molecular weight trends**: The article observed molecular weights were "banging up right against that 500 line" as of 1997 data. Since 2005, molecular weights have continued increasing across the pharmaceutical industry, with many approved drugs exceeding 500 Da. Approved drugs for complex targets (including kinase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, and immunomodulators) routinely exceed these thresholds.

• **Reactivity to rule violations**: The author correctly predicted that dogmatic application of the Rule of Five would prove problematic. In practice, the pharmaceutical industry has maintained the rules as guidelines rather than strict prohibitions. Many approved drugs violate one or more rules while still achieving acceptable oral bioavailability, particularly through formulation optimization or acceptance of alternative administration routes.

• **Tool utilization philosophy**: The characterization of the rules as "a tool meant to pare huge lists of compounds down to manageable size" rather than fate-deciding criteria proved prescient. Pharmaceutical companies have largely maintained this balanced approach, using the rules for library design and high-throughput screening prioritization while allowing flexibility for compounds with promising biological activity.

## 4. INTEREST

Rating: **7/10**

This article provides important perspective on the appropriate use of drug-likeness filters in pharmaceutical research, with insights that have remained relevant as molecular complexity has continued increasing. The measured critique of dogmatic rule application demonstrates enduring wisdom about balancing computational tools with empirical evidence.
