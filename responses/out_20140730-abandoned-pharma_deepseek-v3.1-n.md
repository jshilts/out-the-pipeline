# Abandoned Pharma (July 2014)

## 1. SUMMARY
The article discusses the growing problem of decommissioned pharmaceutical research sites in New Jersey and other regions, particularly in the US and UK. Drawing from personal experience, the author describes how former pharma facilities like Schering-Plough's Bloomfield site in the early 1990s proved difficult to repurpose—eventually being demolished for commercial development (Home Depot). In contrast, some sites like Bayer's West Haven campus were successfully converted to research use by academic institutions (Yale). The article suggests that converting these abandoned facilities into incubators for smaller companies represents a viable alternative to complete demolition.

## 2. HISTORY
The trend of pharmaceutical site closures and repurposing that the article describes accelerated significantly after 2014, driven by continued industry consolidation, mergers, and outsourcing of research activities. Major pharma companies continued to shrink their physical footprints through the late 2010s and into the 2020s. 

Many of these sites have indeed been transformed into life sciences incubators and innovation hubs, particularly in biotech clusters like Boston-Cambridge, San Francisco Bay Area, and Research Triangle Park. Academic institutions have increasingly acquired former pharma facilities, leveraging existing laboratory infrastructure at reduced costs. For example, various former pharma sites have been converted into university-affiliated research parks, continuing the pattern the author observed with Yale's acquisition of the Bayer West Haven campus.

However, the conversion process has remained challenging. Sites requiring extensive renovation or located in less desirable areas often face prolonged vacancy or eventual demolition for commercial or residential development. The COVID-19 pandemic created new dynamics, with increased demand for laboratory space in certain regions due to biotech sector growth, potentially making some of these abandoned sites more attractive for repurposing.

## 3. PREDICTIONS
The article contains implicit rather than explicit predictions about future trends:

• **Conversion to smaller company incubators would be a good plan** - This prediction proved largely accurate, as evidenced by numerous former pharma sites being repurposed as innovation hubs and shared laboratory spaces, particularly in strong biotech markets.

• **Not all sites can be economically repurposed** - Remained true; conversion costs, location desirability, and local market conditions continued to determine whether sites were repurposed for research use or demolished for other development.

• **Academic institutions would continue acquiring former pharma facilities** - This trend continued and even accelerated as universities expanded their research capabilities and sought cost-effective ways to acquire laboratory infrastructure.

## 4. INTEREST
Rating: **5/10**

While the topic remains relevant to understanding the evolution of pharmaceutical industry real estate and research infrastructure, the article primarily documents an ongoing trend rather than forecasting major breakthroughs or fundamental changes in the biotech sector. Its interest lies more in the industrial logistics and economic implications than in scientific or medical advancement.
