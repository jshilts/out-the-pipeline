There's also a list of notable late-stage clinical failures, and unfortunately, these tended to be potentially bigger drugs than the ones that got through last year. 
 I have to wonder if the structures included along with the chart were chosen especially to highlight the occasional "non-druglike" features (acrylamides, aminals, and so on). It's well worth taking a look at new-approval lists and things like the Top 200 Drugs posters (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2011/02/10/the_top_200_drugs) to remind yourself that structures you might have crossed off the screening list are out there making hundreds of millions of dollars.
