Nivolumab Racks Up Another Success
30 Oct 2014

I'm always happy to highlight impressive clinical data, and this is impressive. Bristol-Myers Squibb's nivolumab (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nivolumab) (which has been doing very well (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/03/04/more_good_pd1_news_in_cancer) in clinical trials so far) apparently has very significant effects (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/bristol-myers-nivolumab-impresses-once-again-time-crucial-lung-cancer-study/2014-10-30) in refractory squamous cell lung cancer as well. 41% of the patients on the drug in the latest study are alive at the one-year mark, and expected survival is maybe 15% at best. That's a very tough patient population to treat, and this is very good news. 
 The entire PD-1 therapeutic area looks to change the oncology landscape, because we're just barely getting into what's possible with different approaches and drug combinations. And that's just part of the immunotherapy efforts. Small molecules are going to be a part of this, but they're not going to be in the lead, unless any of you know of reliable small-molecule ways to modulate the appropriate immune pathways, which is no small challenge.
