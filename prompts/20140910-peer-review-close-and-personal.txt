This was the publication that claimed that stem-like cells could be produced by simple acid treatment, and this work has since been shown to be fraudulent. Damaged reputations, bitter accusations, and one suicide have been the result so far, and there are still bent hubcaps wobbling around on the asphalt. 
 The work was published in Nature , but it had been rejected from Science and Cell before finding a home there. That's not unusual in itself - a lot of groundbreaking work has had a surprisingly difficult time getting published. But the kinds of referee reports this got were detailed, well-argued, and strongly critical, which makes you wonder what Nature 's reviewers said, and how the work got published in the form it did, with most (all?) of the troublesome stuff left in. 
 Retraction Watch has obtained the complete text of the referee comments from the Science submission process and published them. Here are some highlights from just the first reviewer: 
 . . .This is such an extraordinary claim that a very high level of proof is required to sustain it and I do not think this level has been reached. I suspect that the results are artifacts derived from the following processes: (1) the tendency of cells with GFP reporters to go green as they are dying. (2) the ease of cross contamination of cell lines kept in the same lab. . . 
 . . .The DNA analysis of the chimeric mice is the only piece of data that does not fit with the contamination theory. But the DNA fragments in the chimeras don’t look the same as those in the lymphocytes. This assay is not properly explained. If it is just an agarose gel then the small bands could be anything. Moreover this figure has been reconstructed. It is normal practice to insert thin white lines between lanes taken from different gels (lanes 3 and 6 are spliced in). Also I find the leading edge of the GL band suspiciously sharp in #2-#5. . . 
 This report and the other two go on to raise a long list of detailed, well-informed criticisms about the experimental design of the work and the amount of information provided. Solutions and reagents are not described in enough detail, images of the cells don't quite show what they're supposed to be showing, and numerous useful controls and normalizations are missing outright. The referees in this case were clearly very familiar with stem cell protocols and behavior, and they did exactly what they were supposed to do with a paper whose claims were as extraordinary as these were. 
 Had any of this stuff been real, meeting the objections of the reviewers would have been possible, and would have significantly improved the resulting paper. This process, in fact, handed the authors a list of exactly the sorts of objections that the scientific community would raise once the paper did get published. And while rejections of this sort are not fun, that's just what they're supposed to provide. Your work needs to be strong enough to stand up to them. 
 Congratulations to the Science and Cell editorial teams (and reviewers) for not letting this get past them. I would guess that publication of these reports will occasion some very painful scenes over at Nature , though - we'll see if they have any comment.
