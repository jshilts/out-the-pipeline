How the New BioPharma IPOs Have Been Doing
10 Feb 2014

Bruce Booth has an update (http://lifescivc.com/2014/02/biotech-ipo-returns-great-good-and-not-so-good/) on how all the recent biotech IPOs have been doing for their investors. Overall, pretty well - which is surely why the market still seems to be humming along, despite several predictions of a dip. Now, that word "investors" covers a lot of ground. You have founders, you have people involved in the various venture capital financing rounds, you have people who bought at the IPO price, and people who've bought in afterwards. These groups are going to have profoundly different returns, but in many cases, there's been something for people to be glad about all the way down the list. Here are some of Booth's conclusions: 
 Big winners are well represented. There are a number of very attractive “Top 10%” returns in this IPO window. Top decile in venture capital has historically been a >5x return across any sector, including tech. These are the 1 in 10 outcomes every VC would love to have, and any LP would love their managers to deliver. 
 The spread of outcomes is considerable. There are as many top decile outcomes as there are money-losing investments. There are a good number of companies that got public at valuations that are significant fractions of their total invested capital. These are clearly the laggards whose shareholders hope the public markets will somehow rescue over time. 
 Post-IPO performance has been a big contributor to returns. The returns into the pricing of most IPOs have been modest – but a majority of the offerings have traded up, a few of them even doubling or tripling since their offerings. . . It's clear to see many of the high flier IPOs have driven the bulk of their “on paper” returns in the after-market. The hope of course is many more biotechs will outperform in future post-IPO trading. 
 There's a lot more data over at Bruce's site. Those post-IPO performance numbers are, naturally, subject to constant revision every trading day, and no one's made any money at all until they've said "sell". But overall, this is probably better performance than a lot of people would have predicted.
