AstraZeneca Says No Again
19 May 2014

Now what? Pfizer has upped its offer (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-18/pfizer-raises-offer-for-astrazeneca-to-117-billion.html) for AstraZeneca yet again, and up to the figure that they seem to have calculated would bring them to the negotiating table. But AZ has told them to buzz off yet again, sending their own shares down hard. That's because Pfizer also stated that they would not launch a hostile bid for the company and that the current offer was final, so there don't seem to many more options. 
 I'll be pretty surprised by this story if it ends this way. It's possible that Pfizer is planning on AstraZeneca's big shareholders putting pressure on the company before the May 26th deadline (mandated by UK law). Or they might turn around and try buying them again in the future, especially if anything goes a bit wrong with AZ's turnaround plans over the next few months. But for now, it looks like we have the first case I can recall of a Company That Has Fought Off Pfizer. 
 But as that article (http://www.taxanalysts.com/www/features.nsf/Articles/8A8A34FCBD7C3C3F85257BA200497696?OpenDocument) I linked to the other day details, Pfizer has to do something about its tax situation. So if it's not going to be the AstraZeneca acquisition (and we still have a few days on that one), then what? The last thing I expect them to do is just sit there.
