Detox and Cleanse Yourself Away From the Food Babe's Advice
6 Nov 2014

I'm glad that this blog post (http://www.scibabe.com/food-babes-bullshit-habits/) exists. It's a lengthy, detailed rebuttal to a sheet of advice that the "Food Babe" recommends for her followers. For example, you are apparently supposed to start off the day with some warm lemon juice in water with some cayenne pepper in it. Why would I do that to myself, you ask - to ensure that nothing worse happens to me the rest of the day? No, you fools, you do it to "eliminate environmental and lifestyle toxins" from your system by waking up your liver. And so on, and very much so on. 
 Life is just too short to swat every bizarre misconception (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/07/18/chemistry_class_for_the_food_babe) caroming around inside Vani Hari's skull. It's pandemonium in there, because the clerks at the front desk are clearly not very selective. But when someone does take the time (http://wavefunction.fieldofscience.com/2014/07/the-problem-with-food-babe.html) , I'll gladly point it out. There's plenty for everyone.
