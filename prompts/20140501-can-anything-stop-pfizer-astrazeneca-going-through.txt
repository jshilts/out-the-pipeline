Can Anything Stop Pfizer-AstraZeneca From Going Through?
1 May 2014

At FierceBiotech, John Carroll asks the question (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/can-anything-prevent-pfizers-megamerger-astrazeneca/2014-05-01) that's on a lot of drug-industry minds this week: can anything stop Pfizer's takeover of AstraZeneca? 
 There are a few possibilities, but overall, it comes down to how much money Pfizer wants to spend. If they open their wallet far enough, they can buy most anyone they want. As long as the UK's tax structure stays as it is, I think that they'll keep right on pitching. (Now, if another prime minister comes in whose government has a different view on corporate taxation, that could make Pfizer regret things, but they're clearly willing to take that chance). No, they did the same sort of thing to Wyeth, to Pharmacia-Upjohn, and to Warner-Lambert, without these sorts of tax considerations, so I don't see why they wouldn't do it to AstraZeneca, too. Well, short of not wanting to destroy another big drug company. But that's not on Carroll's list, and not on mine, because it sure isn't a consideration for Pfizer, is it?
