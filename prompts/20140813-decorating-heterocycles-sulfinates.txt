That's a class of compound that, until recently years, not too many people have cared about - partly because they're generally not a lot of fun to make. The sulfinate acid oxidation state does not appear to be a happy one. Reductive routes exist down from the sulfonic end, but they're not reliable, and oxidations often don't stop at this state on the way up, either. Back in my sulfone/sulfoxide days in the early 1990s, I used to prepare sulfinate salts from organolithiums or Grignard reagents by bubbling in sulfur dioxide. And while that works (although not all the time), it's not that wonderful a route, either. Just thinking about it, I can taste the swampy, choking vapors coming out of the saturated solution at the end of the reaction. 
 I was making sulfinate esters to prepare chiral sulfoxides, which was one of the main reasons anyone would visit that functional group in synthesis. But since then it's been appreciated that sulfinates are excellent radical precursors, allowing for some very useful carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions. And that's what this new paper provides: a way to produce sulfinates straight from a wide variety of carboxylic acids by using modified Barton chemistry. The paper shows several otherwise-nearly-impossible reagents (like N-Boc azetidine-3-sulfinate), and also shows how these things will step in and staple onto heterocyclic rings directly through the radical reaction. 
 Their prime example is a recently reported isostere for a t-butyl group, the trifluoromethylcyclopropyl. That's a hindered beast, so many routes that you might think of to use it are going to be troublesome, but the radical reaction works quite well. I think that medicinal chemists are going to be particularly interested in this reaction, since we're so often functionalizing hetercyclic rings, and we'd like to be able to quickly expand an SAR series by sticking one group after another onto the same substrate. This sort of C-H functionalization is not something you'd think of if you're just running over the classic reactions in your head, but everyone should start adding it to their mental lists.
