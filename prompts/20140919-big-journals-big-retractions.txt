Big Journals, Big Retractions
19 Sep 2014

Big high-impact journals have more retractions (http://www.nature.com/news/why-high-profile-journals-have-more-retractions-1.15951) , it seems. I can see how that would be, because there are several forces at work. People want to publish their splashy, cutting-edge results in the big-name journals, and a higher percentage of those papers are wrong to start with, as opposed to more incremental ones. And the big papers in the big journals get more scrutiny, so they're more likely to be picked apart when there's something wrong with them. I would have been surprised if this correlation had come out any other way, actually.
