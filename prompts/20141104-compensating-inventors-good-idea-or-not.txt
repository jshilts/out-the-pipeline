Compensating Inventors: Good Idea Or Not?
4 Nov 2014

As an inventor of a new drug here in the US, you are most certainly on the patents that have been filed around it. What do these patents earn for you? Well, in the US, they earn you a hearty handshake (like the one that W. C. Fields used to get when he stopped a bank robber). And this is made clear when you sign up with a company: you assign the rights to your inventions to the company, and if you don't wish to do that, you can go somewhere else and do something else for a living. You may well get a raise or a promotion on the strength of your work (or not!), but the fact of being an inventor on one of the few lucrative pharma patents has no direct effects. 
 That's not the case in many companies. Germany, for one, is well known to have a patent remuneration system: under German law, those listed as inventors on a patent are entitled to compensation, and that includes a share of the profit that an invention generates. France is somewhat similar, and several other European countries have at least partial compensation as a concept in their patent laws ( here's a PDF (http://www.cov.com/files/Publication/4ffe8880-deba-493a-8994-2a69f0da78dd/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/3b0e8983-fe2a-41b5-9e96-2fb6c8a3a8c1/Employee%E2%80%99s%20Rights%20to%20Compensation%20for%20Inventions%20-%20A%20European%20Perspective.pdf) on the topic). Those variations are complex: in some cases, the invention has to be of "outstanding" value, and in others, the compensation is not automatic, or the inventor has to demonstrate that their salary, etc. was not fair remuneration for the value of the invention to their employer. Germany is pretty clear-cut, though. 
 And in recent years, China has put in a similar system. Chinese patent law is not for the faint of heart, that's for sure. It's still an evolving system, since a coherent intellectual property regime was not a priority during most of the last century. Large regulatory changes are still taking place, and doubtless will do so in the future. And it's a lively area, because Chinese companies sue each other (http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2011/11/06/key-considerations-for-patent-strategies-in-china/id=20241/) with great vigor and frequency over IP issues, which can mean a lot of court decisions to keep up with. No, you're going to want to pay some hard-working folks a lot of money if you want to get seriously into Chinese patents. Even then, you will be afflicted by doubts as to how much protection these patents afford you. 
 In 2010, Chinese patent law changed (http://bricwallblog.wordpress.com/2013/05/23/understanding-chinese-inventor-reward-and-remuneration/) , and one change was the emphasis on inventor compensation. The law states that the inventor or inventors should be paid "a reasonable rumuneration" based on the use of the patented invention, and it was also stated that this applies to all businesses that have Chinese patents, regardless of the nationalities of the inventors. I'm not sure if it's been completely worked out in the courts what "reasonable" might mean. That link above goes on to mention that other clauses of the law have it that a company should have a set scheme for remuneration in its contacts with its employees, or a standard corporate policy on it. If nothing like that is in place, the inventor is supposed to get no less than 2% of the annual profits. Definitely worth knowing about if you're doing business there. 
 Discussion of these compensation plans always comes down to a discussion of inventorship. That can be a bit contentious in the US, but such disagreements are nothing compared to the elbow-throwing under the German system (as can be easily imagined). Not too many drug patents ever make money, but the ones that do can make vast amounts, and being an inventor on one of those is very desirable indeed. What happens, I believe, is that a separate bureaucracy develops just to make sure that all questions of inventorship have been settled correctly. Did you make the "inventive step", or were you just carrying out the inventive step of someone else? Did your contribution rise to the level of such an inventive step, to start with? How well did you document that? And so on. 
 At one time (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2004/02/01/deal_me_in) , I thought that the inventor-compensation idea was hard to beat. I still wouldn't mind the money, should I happen to ever get on a patent that makes some. But over time, I've come to wonder about the downsides. Under such a system, there is less incentive for people to throw ideas around in an informal setting. Those lead to disputes about just who said what and when. No, you tend to keep those ideas to yourself until you can get them written down and dated, with your name on them, and I can't help but think that this puts a bit of sand in the gears of discovery. If you're always watching your back, that level of inhibition might be enough to keep you from having as many ideas as you might, in general - it doesn't take much.
