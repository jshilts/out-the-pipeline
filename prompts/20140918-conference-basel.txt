Conference in Basel
18 Sep 2014

I wanted to let people know that next week I'll be attending the FBLD (http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/fbld/2014/) (Fragment-Based Ligand Design) meeting in Basel, Switzerland. I'm looking forward to it - there are a number of good talks on the agenda, and it's always nice to attend a specialized conference where you're interested in the great majority of what's on offer. (Sitting through bad or irrelevant talks, as I've mentioned, becomes harder and harder for me every year). I hope to do some blogging from the conference itself as interesting topics come up. 
 If there are folks in Basel who'd like to meet up while I'm in town, it looks like I'll be free on Monday and Wednesday evening, so drop me an e-mail and maybe we can find a place to meet.
