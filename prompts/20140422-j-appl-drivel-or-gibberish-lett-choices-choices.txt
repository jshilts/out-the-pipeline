J. Appl. Drivel or Gibberish Lett.? Choices, Choices.
22 Apr 2014

People keep hoaxing the predatory "scholarly" publishers out there, and the publishers keep falling for whatever drivel is slung at them. Here's the latest example (http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/blinded-by-scientific-gobbledygook) from a reporter at the Ottawa Citizen , Tom Spears. He molded a pile of steaming gibberish into the rough shape of a manuscript, and that was more than enough: 
 I have just written the world’s worst science research paper: More than incompetent, it’s a mess of plagiarism and meaningless garble. . . 
 . . .I copied and pasted one phrase [in the title] from a geology paper online, and the rest from a medical one, on hematology. 
 I wrote the whole paper that way, copying and pasting from soil, then blood, then soil again, and so on. There are a couple of graphs from a paper about Mars. They had squiggly lines and looked cool, so I threw them in. 
 Footnotes came largely from a paper on wine chemistry. The finished product is completely meaningless. 
 The university where I claim to work doesn’t exist. Nor do the Nepean Desert or my co-author. Software that catches plagiarism identified 67 per cent of my paper as stolen (and that’s missing some). And geology and blood work don’t mix, even with my invention of seismic platelets. 
 And you guessed it - the acceptances came rolling in, and pretty damned quickly, too. Peer-reviewed, refereed, and edited within 24 hours - where are you going to find an honest journal with service like that? 16 of the 18 bottom-feeding "journals" accepted it, and one of the rejections suggested that it just needed a bit of tweaking to be accepted. And one of the publishers has asked Spears to serve on an editorial advisory board, so he's clearly got what it takes. 
 Of course, as yesterday's post (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/04/21/molecular_printing_of_drug_molecules_say_what) shows, even a peer-reviewed journal with a recognizable name can publish gibberish. But I assume that Drug Discovery Today and Elsevier didn't charge the author $1000 to do it. On the other hand, they might have taken more than 18 hours to review the manuscript. Or not.
