Photoredox Marches On
12 May 2014

I found this paper (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja501621q) from the MacMillan group on photochemical decarboxylation pretty interesting, but I always find new ways to make carbon-carbon bonds worth reading about. It uses the more-and-more-popular photoredox catalysts (in this case, the iridium series), and it builds on this earlier publication (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/20831195/) from the group. That showed that aryl nitriles were good coupling partners in these reactions, and those feature in every example in the new paper. 

One thing that I noticed, though, when I got to the experimental details (which are all in the Supporting Information). When you see, for example, N-Boc proline being coupled with dicyanobenzene, which one do you think the yield is based on? Maybe it's just my weltanschauung as a medicinal chemist, but I see the proline as the core and the dicyanobenzene as a partner, probably used in some excess, that's being coupled to it. But the experiments are run with the nitrile as the limiting reagent, with three equivalents of Boc-proline (or most any other amino acid). 
 I'm going to give the reaction a try, though - it looks simple enough to run, and it gets you into some interesting structures very quickly. I definitely appreciate the way this works with Boc and Cbz amino acids, as opposed to N-tosyl derivatives (seeing those is always a letdown - I know that they can be removed, but no one uses them as nitrogen protecting groups if anything else works instead). And the paper shows an impressive range of examples, which is very welcome. I have some other electron-deficient coupling partners in mind, and I'd like to see if you can run the thing in some other solvent besides straight DMSO, but first I'll see how well the canonical version works for me.
