The New York TImes on Drug Discovery
14 Nov 2014

The New York Times Magazine has a piece (http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/magazine/why-are-there-so-few-new-drugs-invented-today.html) on the current problems with drug discovery. I was interviewed by the author, and get I quoted at one point. 
 Nothing in the article will amaze any regular reader here, but it's probably the first time many of the magazine's readership are hearing about many of these issues, so I hope it'll be useful in that regard. Those readers might end up tying the concepts of genomics and target-based drug discovery together a bit too tightly, but it's a lot of catching up to do in a small space.
