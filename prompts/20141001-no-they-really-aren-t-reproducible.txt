This part caught my attention: 
 We have a problem. Some people claim that important papers cannot be replicated. I think this is an argument that has been made by the drug companies. They claim that they take observations in the literature and they can't reproduce them, but what I wonder is whether they're really reproducing the experiments or simply trying to develop a drug in an animal model and not exactly repeating the experiments in the publication. But I think it is unknown what fraction of the literature is wrong, so we're conducting an experiment. We've been approached by an organization called the Reproducibility Project, where a private foundation has agreed to provide funds for experiments in the fifty most highly cited papers in cancer biology to be reproduced, and the work will be contracted out to laboratories for replication. And we've agreed to handle this and eventually to publish the replication studies, so we'll see, you know, at least with these fifty papers. How many of them really have reproducibility. The reproducibility studies will be published in eLife. We're just getting going in that, so it may be a couple of years, but that's what we'd like to do. 
 OK, then. As one of those drug-company people, I can tell you that we actually do try to run the exact experiment in these papers. We may run that second, after we've tried to reproduce things in our own assays and failed, but we never write things off unless we've tried to do exactly what the paper said to do . And many times, it still doesn't work. Or it gives a readout in that system, but we have strong reason to believe that the assay in the original work was flawed or misinterpreted. We are indeed trying to develop drugs, but (and I speak from personal experience here, and more than once), when we call something irreproducible, that's because we can't actually reproduce it. 
 And the problem with trying to reproduce the 50 most-cited papers (see Update below!) is that most of those are probably going to work pretty well. That's why they're so highly cited. The stuff that doesn't work are the splashy new press-released papers in Nature , Cell , Science , or PNAS , the one that say that Protein X turns out to be a key player in Disease Y, or that Screening Compound Z turns out to be a great ligand for it. Some of those are right, but too many of them are wrong. They haven't been in the literature long enough to pick up a mound of citations, but when we see these things, we get right to work on them to see if we believe them. 
 And there really are at least two layers of trouble, as mentioned. Reproducibility is one: can you get the exact thing to happen that the paper reports? That's the first step, and it fails more than it should. But if things do work as advertised, that still doesn't mean that the paper's conclusions are correct. People miss things, overinterpret, didn't run a key control, and so on. If someone reports a polyphenolic rhodanine as a wonderful ligand for The Hot Protein of the Moment, odds are that you can indeed reproduce the results in their assay. But that doesn't mean that the paper is much good to anyone at all, because said rhodanine is overwhelmingly unlikely to be of any use. Run it through an assay panel, and it lights up half the board - try interpreting cell data from that, and good luck. So you have Non-Reproducible, and Reproducible, For All the Good That Does. 
 But if Shekman and the Reproducibility Project are looking for tires to kick, I recommend picking the fifty papers from the last two or three years that caused the most excitement, press releases, and press coverage. New cancer target! Stem cell breakthrough! Lead structure for previously undruggable pathway! Try that stuff out, and see how much of it stands up. 
 Update: this interview turns out not to be quite correct about the papers that will be reproduced. More details here (https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/studies/) , and thanks to Tim in the comments for this. It's actually the "50 most impactful" papers from 2010 through 2012, which sounds a lot more like what I have in mind above. Here's the list (https://docs.google.com/a/virginia.edu/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApshURhC8ht3dGtaRkRsb1pFRDkyc1gtdUtCSGlXY2c&rm=full#gid=0) . This will be quite interesting. . .
