GSK Dismisses Employees in Bribery Scandal. Apparently.
4 Apr 2014

Someone is letting it be known (http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/04/us-gsk-china-idUSBREA330TF20140404) that GlaxoSmithKline has fired some of its employees in China in relation to the long-running bribery scandal there. This is one of those times when it's worth asking the "Cui bono?" follow-up question. Is this some sort of semi-authorized release, designed to show other GSK employees that the company is serious? Or to demonstrate the same, publicly, to the Chinese authorities? Or is someone honestly just letting this information out on their own - and if so, why?
