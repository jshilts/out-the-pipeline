German Pharma, Or What's Left of It
7 Oct 2014

Busy day around here on the frontiers of science, so I haven't had a chance to get a post up. A reader did send along this article (http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/unternehmen/arzneikonzerne-die-versaeumnisse-der-pharmabranche-13190825.html) from the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung , the heavyweight German newspaper known as the "Fahts" (FAZ). (The Chrome browser will run Google's auto-translate past it if you ask, and it comes out sort of coherent). 
 What they're asking is: how and why did the German pharmaceutical industry decline so much? Parts have been sold off (as with Hoechst and BASF), and some remaining players have merged (as with Bayer and Schering AG). There's still Boehringer and Merck (Darmstadt), but they're fairly far down the rankings in size and drug R&D expenditure. And you don't have to compare things just to the US: all this has taken place while the folks just down up the river (Novartis and Roche) have looked much stronger. The article is blaming "Wankelmut" (vacillation, fickleness) at the strategic level for much of this, especially regarding the role of an industrial chemicals division versus a pharma one. 
 There's something to that. Bayer was urged for years and years by analysts to break up the company, and resisted. Until recently - but now they're going to do it. Meanwhile, the other big German chemistry conglomerates did just that, but divested their pharma ends off to other companies (and countries) rather than spinning them out on their own. And there's not much of a German startup/biotech sector backstopping any of this, either. The successes of Amgen, Biogen, Genentech et al. have not happened in Germany - for the most part, players there stay where they are. The big firms stay the big firms, and no one joins their ranks. 
 And that's what strikes me about many economies in general, as compared to the US. We have more turmoil. It's not always a good thing, but we're also had a lot of science and technology-based companies come out of nowhere to become world leaders. And you can't do that without shaking things around. Is it partly an aversion to that sort of disruption that's led to the current state of affairs, or is this mistaking symptoms for causes? (I mean, the Swiss are hardly known for wild swings in their business sectors, but Swiss pharma has done fine). Thoughts?
