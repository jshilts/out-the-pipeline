There are several points made. For one, there is far more publicly available information than ever before, and its total looks to outstrip the proprietary databases (such as CAS/SciFinder). The commercial databases, though, have the advantage of much better curation, and they remain far better for doing freedom-to-operate type searches on potential chemical matter. 
 But even with that advantage, searching out prior art and prior knowledge on a given structural series is not easy. The paper goes through a detailed description of the steps that might be involved if, say, one of the NIH Molecular Libraries probes turns out to be an interesting hit. Some of these have extensive annotation, and some don't. Getting a searchable string for a given compound (CAS#, SMILES, etc.) is not always straighforward, either, with issues around tautomers, double bond geometries, and salt forms. Then once you do a search, you can find some odd things: 
 It should be noted that if the structure search within SciFinder fails to find a CAS registry number, the search can be repeated as a similarity search to ensure that the registry number was not missed because of a salt form. Once the CAS registry number is found, the total number of literature references with biological activity captured in SciFinder can be retrieved. It is at this point that any reference to the 2009 Goldfarb U.S. patent application on life extension in eukaryotic organisms (US 20090163545) (http://www.google.com/patents/US20090163545) should be noted. 
 US20090163545 contains a data table (Figure 16 in the patent) on 499 compounds with PubChem substance IDs. However, SciFinder abstracts 6018 substances. How can this be? The patent includes the phrase, referring explicitly to (PubChem assay ID) 775, “the contents of which are herein incorporated in their entirety by reference”. This is full data disclosure taken to an extreme via subsummation of public HTS data into a patent by reference. While only 5796 substances from the HTS were referenced as “use” substances in SciFinder, 132 781 compounds were specified in the HTS (i.e., 32% of the entire Molecular Libraries screening collection, MLSMR). Thus, while this may be an exceptional patent abstraction example in SciFinder, it nonetheless illustrates how intellectual property (IP) due diligence searching can be confounded. Across the set of 322 NIH MLP probes, 72 intersect with the CIDs from AID 775, so a significant proportion will also intersect with the US20090163545 exemplifications. We were initially worried that a reference to this patent application was somehow an indicator for a flawed or promiscuous compound. We now believe the prevalence of references to this single patent application is an example of how complete data disclosure can lead to unexpected and potentially harmful consequences when performing IP due diligence. 
 Furthermore, not all of the structures of the NIH's MLP chemical probes are even referenced in SciFinder, weirdly (thus the "parallel worlds" of the paper's title). There are many other problems - for example, as the authors note, probably about half of the "commercially available" compounds are not actually available at all, and many have never actually been made. They're just listed because one supplier or another regards them as makeable on demand (everyone who's spent any time ordering compounds has encountered this, surely). So should such things be indexed? Have they been exemplified, in the legal sense? 
 And we haven't even gotten to the associated biological assay data. Comparing assays across different groups and different times is notoriously difficult - even inside single drug companies, details of the assay protocols have to be available in great detail to make sure that things are relevant. And that level of detail is often just not available in many database searches. Here's an enzyme, here's an IC50, and there you are. Good luck! The situation is a bit chaotic: 
 This discussion leads us to ask whether compounds in databases without any experimental data and without any link to potential utility should be considered as prior art. This class of compounds is growing dramatically, especially in the public databases, and the utility is arguably markedly less than for prophetic compounds. . .in patents, which may not be real compounds in an experimental sense but for which the relationship to experimentally tested compounds is at least clear. Such prophetic compounds have been abstracted in SciFinder since December 2007. As we have described earlier, the days when one could assume SciFinder had captured everything relevant to the entire global realm of bioactive chemistry are perhaps well passed. By definition, no quantitative assessment (such as the statistics of structure matching) across databases is possible without access to all of them, and to our knowledge this has not been undertaken to date. . . 
 The authors end with a call for the various database vendors and curators to hold some sort of summit meeting to keep things from diverging any more. We could end up in a situation where searching across multiple incompatible semi-redundant databases would be the only way to have any confidence that one had found what there is to find. Actually, that's the situation we're already in. We need to make that better, and the first step is to keep it from getting any worse.
