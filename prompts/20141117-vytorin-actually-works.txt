Vytorin Actually Works
17 Nov 2014

The data from the IMPROVE-IT trial on cardiovascular outcomes (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/11/13/remember_vytorin_the_data_are_finally_coming) for Vytorin have been released. And the combination met the primary endpoint: fewer heart attacks and strokes compared to those already on statin therapy alone. 
 Matthew Herper has an excellent roundup (http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2014/11/17/surprise-vytorin-works-here-are-five-things-you-should-know/) of the results and their context. The effect is real, but it's not gigantic, either, so the cost/benefit argument will go on (or at least it will for another couple of years, when the drug goes generic). It is a boost, though, for the use of LDL as a biomarker for cardiovascular risk: a different mechanism to lower LDL (cholesterol absorption inhibition), when added to a statin, decreased the risk. Some are wondering about other effects of ezetimibe (the cholesterol absorption inhibitor itself) influencing the result, but I'm not so sure about that. From what I know about the compound, it's hardly absorbed at all, and most of its effects are indeed in the gut wall. Update: nope, I'm hallucinating again (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15871634) . 
 Now it's time to speculate how things might have been if the earlier ENHANCE trial hadn't been handled so clumsily (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2008/04/01/vytorin_its_a_pity) by Merck and Schering-Plough. The suspicion that brought on the drug hurt its sales, and according to today's results, hurt patients as well who didn't get treated with it. If you think being up front about bad results will hurt you, take a look at the costs of looking deceitful.
