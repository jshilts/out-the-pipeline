But this paper (http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/op500100b) in Organic Process R&D manages to get away with it in a preparation of a fluoronaphthyridine. It's a good illustration of what process chemistry is all about - not ruling anything out in the quest for a reliable, scalable route. Sure glad it wasn't me, though - even diluted in nitrogen, I have no desire to work with elemental fluorine. I'm fine with all those effete, over-refined, decadent fluorination reagents - but then, I don't have to clean their by-products out of a multikilo reaction, either!
