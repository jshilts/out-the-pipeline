AZ has been getting out of CNS indications for some time now, so they really did need a partner here, and Lilly l ost their own (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/06/14/a_betasecretase_inhibitor_hits_the_skids_in_alzheimers) beta-secretase compound last year. So this move doesn't come as too much of a shock, but it does reaffirm Lilly's bet-the-ranch approach to Alzheimer's. 
 This compound was used by AZ in their defense against being taken over by Pfizer, but (as that link in the first paragraph shows), not everyone was buying their estimated chances of success (9%). Since the overall chances for success in Alzheimer's, historically, have ranged between zero and 1%, depending on what you call a success, I can see their point. But beta-secretase deserves to have another good shot taken at it, and we'll see what happens. It'll takes years, though, before we find out - Alzheimer's trials are painfully slow, like the disease itself. 
 Update: I've had mail asking what I mean by AZ "getting out of CNS indications", when they still have a CNS research area. That's true, but it's a lot different than it used to be. The company got rid of most of its own infrastructure (http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/News/2012/February/astrazeneca-restructuring-pharma-jobs.asp) , and is doing more (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/tufts-joins-astrazenecas-virtual-cns-drug-development-team/2013-07-17) of a virtual/collaborative approach. So no, in one sense they haven't exited the field at all. But a lot of its former CNS people (and indeed, whole research sites) certainly exited AstraZeneca.
