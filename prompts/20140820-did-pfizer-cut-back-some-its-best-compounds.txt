Did Pfizer Cut Back Some of Its Best Compounds?
20 Aug 2014

John LaMattina has a look (http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnlamattina/2014/08/19/the-negative-impact-of-pfizers-mergers-and-budget-cuts-on-cancer-rd/) at Pfizer's oncology portfolio, and what their relentless budget-cutting has been doing to it. The company is taking some criticism for having outlicensed two compounds ( tremelimumab (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremelimumab) to AstraZeneca and neratinib to Puma (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/07/23/neratinib_comes_through_for_puma) ) which seem to be performing very well after Pfizer ditched them. Here's LaMattina (a former Pfizer R&D head, for those who don't know): 
 Unfortunately, over 15 years of mergers and severe budget cuts, Pfizer has not been able to prosecute all of the compounds in its portfolio. Instead, it has had to make choices on which experimental medicines to keep and which to set aside. However, as I have stated before (http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnlamattina/2014/06/10/biopharmaceutical-industry-consolidation-diminishes-future-drug-discovery/) , these choices are filled with uncertainties as oftentimes the data in hand are far from complete. But in oncology, Pfizer seems to be especially snake-bit in the decisions it has made. 
 That goes for their internal compounds, too. As LaMattina goes one to say, palbociclib (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palbociclib) is supposed to be one of their better compounds (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/04/07/is_palbociclib_promising_or_not) , but it was shelved for several years due to more budget-cutting and the belief that the effort would be better spent elsewhere. It would be easy for an outside observer to whack away at the company and wonder how incompetent they could be to walk away from all these winners, but that really isn't fair. It's very hard in oncology to tell what's going to work out and what isn't - impossible, in fact, after compounds have progressed to a certain stage. The only way to be sure is to take these things on into the clinic and see, unfortunately (and there you have one of the reasons things are so expensive around here). 
 Pfizer brought up more interesting compounds than it later was able to develop. It's a good question to wonder what they could have done with these if they hadn't been pursuing their well-known merger strategy over these years, but we'll never know the answer to that one. The company got too big and spent too much money, and then tried to cure that by getting even bigger. Every one of those mergers was a big disruption, and you sometimes wonder how anyone kept their focus on developing anything. Some of its drug-development choices were disastrous and completely their fault (the Exubera inhaled-insulin fiasco (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2007/10/22/surveying_the_exubera_crater) , for example), but their decisions in their oncology portfolio, while retrospectively awful, were probably quite defensible at the time. But if they hadn't been occupied with all those upheavals over the last ten to fifteen years, they might have had a better chance on focusing on at least a few more of their own compounds. 
 Their last big merger was with Wyeth. If you take Pfizer's R&D budget and Wyeth's and add them, you don't get Pfizer's R&D post-merger. Not even close. Pfizer's R&D is smaller now than their budget was alone before the deal . Pyrrhus (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhus_of_Epirus) would have recognized the problem.
