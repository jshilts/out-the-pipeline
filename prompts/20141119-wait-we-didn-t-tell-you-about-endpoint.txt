Wait, We Didn't Tell You About That Endpoint?
19 Nov 2014

Hmm. Via Twitter, we find this interesting example of moving the goalposts. NeoStem, a small stem-cell company, announced results the other day for a trial of their cardiac stem cell therapy. One bearish trader who'd been following them was surprised (http://caps.fool.com/Pitch/NBS/7266188/when-i-saw-that-neostem-stock-.aspx) that the stock didn't drop more on the results, given that the trial didn't seem to have reached its primary endpoints at all. 
 But that's when he discovered that the primary endpoints had been changed . Here's the record (http://clinicaltrials.gov/archive/NCT01495364/2014_11_17/changes) at ClincialTrials.gov, and you can see that a lot has been taken out, and a lot added. Measurements of mycocardial perfusion have been de-emphasized, and if you guessed that the company saw no differences there in the trial data, your psychic powers are functional today. Measurements of major adverse cardiac events, though, have been added, and if you guessed that the company did see encouraging numbers there, you're two for two. And if by "encouraging", you meant "but still not statistically significant", then you should head for the race track this afternoon, because you're on fire. 
 So how much of this sort of thing is allowable? From what I know, this is over some sort of line, but I don't know the ins and outs of Clinicaltrials.gov, never having seen a case quite like this before. Any thoughts? As for NeoStem themselves, their press release (http://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/neostem-announces-initial-positive-data-from-phase-2-preserve-ami-clinical-trial-20141117-01152) was all about "positive data", but the stock, which had moved up on Friday and Monday in anticipation, did end up with a substantial loss. Would it have been even more substantial if more people had read more closely?
