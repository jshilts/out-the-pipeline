Whatever Happened to the Fish and the Frogs?
4 Dec 2014

Eight or ten years ago, there was a good deal of excitement about non-mammalian small animal model systems for compound screening - specifically fish and frogs. More specifically, zebrafish and Xenopus . A number of small companies started up to do this sort of thing, and large companies paid attention as well. A correspondent, though, wrote me the other day noting that few (if any) of these companies seem to have made it. Phylonix (http://www.phylonix.com/newsinfo.htm) and Znomics (http://www.znomics.com/) seem to be inactive, and InDanio (http://www.indanio.com/) , while apparently still with us, has a low profile. (Are there others?) 
 More generally, it's worth asking what's become of the whole idea. I've read some interesting papers over the years using these systems in compound screening, mostly uncovering effects developmental pathways. But how has it worked out overall? There are still people working in the field, of course, but have they been able to get any traction in drug discovery? From my perspective, I just know that I seem to hear a lot less about this than I did a few years back. 
 Is there still a zebrafish case to be made, or one for the (evolutionarily closer) Xenopus ? If so, is that case best made for developmental biology/embryology, or for more open-ended high-content phenotypic screening, or for toxicology? Thoughts welcome.
