Jailhouse Secrets They Don't Want You to Know About!
18 Mar 2014

As I had hoped last year (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/11/13/kevin_trudeau_goes_to_jail_at_long_last) , scam artist Kevin Trudeau is indeed heading off for a ten-year sentence. I have searched, without success, for a photo of him wearing an orange jumpsuit and being bundled into a windowless prison van, but we'll just have to use our imaginations for that. Not to worry - a good steam cleaning, and the vehicle will be surely be fit to transport honest burglers again. 
 Trudeau had been convicted of criminal contempt, for egregiously violating earlier court orders to stop ripping people off through his all-natural-cures informercial empire. Past entries (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2005/08/28/kevin_trudeaus_snake_oil_empire) here have detailed (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2006/08/15/kevin_trudeau_was_born_in_1963) what the man is like, and if you know anything about chemistry or biology, twenty seconds of listening to any of his pitches has usually been enough to make you bury your head in your hands. But there are untold millions of people out there who know nothing about either subject, and are willing to listen when someone spins them tales of wonderful medicines and cures that the great shadowy "They" don't want anyone to know about. Trudeau cynically raked in the cash by appealing to ignorance and promoting suspicion. With any luck, we shall not see his like again. But I'm afraid we will.
