A Free Online Med-Chem Course
22 Sep 2014

Erland Stevens at Davidson is going to be running an online med-chem course (https://www.edx.org/course/davidsonx/davidsonx-d001x-medicinal-chemistry-2711#.VCAiOS5dW4x) on EdX, the MOOC platform founded by Harvard and MIT. It starts in October, runs for 8 weeks, can be audited for free, and covers these topics: 
 (1) The drug approval process (early drugs, clinical trials, IP factors) 
 (2) Enzymes and receptors (inhibition, Ki, types of ligands, Kd) 
 (3) Pharmacokinetics (Vd, CL, compartment models) 
 (4) Metabolism (phase I and II, genetic factors, prodrugs) 
 (5) Molecular diversity (drug space, combi chem, libraries) 
 (6) Lead discovery (screening, filtering hits) 
 (7) Lead optimization (FG replacements, isosteres, peptidomimetics) 
 (8) Important drug classes (selected examples) 
 So if you know someone who would like to have a better understanding of the basics of med-chem and has been looking for an opportunity, this might be the answer. Stevens taught this one in the spring on the same platform, and had 14,000 people sign up at the beginning. 
 Update: from the comments, there's another med-chem course starting on Coursera shortly, from UCSD: https://www.coursera.org/course/drugdiscovery.
