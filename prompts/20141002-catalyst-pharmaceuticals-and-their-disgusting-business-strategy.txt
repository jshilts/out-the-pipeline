Catalyst Pharmaceuticals and Their Disgusting Business Strategy
2 Oct 2014

OK, this seems to be a new business model, damn it all. I wrote here recently about the huge price increase (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/09/11/the_most_unconscionable_drug_price_hike_i_have_yet_seen) of Thiola (tiopronin) by a small company called Retrophin. 
 Now, as I wrote about (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/10/21/catalyst_pharmaceuticals_and_their_business_plan) here last year, another small company called Catalyst Pharmaceuticals is preparing to jack up the price of Firdapse (3,4-diaminopyridine) for the rare disorder Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert%E2%80%93Eaton_myasthenic_syndrome) (LEMS). 
 This disease is so rare, and the drug is so easily available, that it is currently being given away for free. But Catalyst is going to make sure that it won't stay free for long. Not at all (http://www.thestreet.com/story/12895858/1/catalyst-pharma-closer-to-unconscionable-price-hike-for-rare-disease-drug.html) : 
 There was never any doubt about Firdapse's ability to treat LEMS symptoms effectively because it's the same active drug as 3,4-Dap. With that perspective, Catalyst's triumphant press release Monday is all the more galling. The company took no risks with Firdapse. The company did no development work, made no effort to improve the drug's efficacy, safety or convenience for patients. The only thing Catalyst did was write a check to Biomarin and take over supervision of a Firdapse clinical trial already well underway. 
 For the zero work done by Catalyst, LEMS patients and their insurance companies will be paying as much as $80,000 for the exact same drug they use now for a fraction of the cost, if not gratis. 
 To just add a rancid cherry on top, that piece by Adam Feuerstein also details the way the company is apparently intimidating LEMS patients by telling them that they'll need to be deposed in a shareholder lawsuit. Now this is what regulatory failure looks like. I can think of no possible reason, no public good that comes from taking a drug that was easily available and working exactly as it should and have someone suddenly be able to charge $80,000 a year for it. This is not a reward for innovation or risk-taking - this is exploitation of a regulatory loophole, a blatant shakedown, or so it seems to me. 
 Why does the FDA let this happen? It brings the agency into disrepute, and the whole drug industry as well, and for no benefit at all. Well, unless you're the sort of person who executes one of these business plans, in which case you should get out of my sight. Too many people already think that all drug companies do is grab someone else's inexpensive compound and then raise the price as high as they possibly can. Watching people like Catalyst and Retrophin actually live the stereotype is infuriating. 
 Update: The previous licensee for this drug, Biomarin (in Europe) was harshly criticized for just this sort of business plan. Here is an open letter (http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c6466.full) from 2010 from a group of British physicians to Prime Minister David Cameron, and its opening paragraph succinctly describes the problem here: 
 ". . .The original purpose of this (orphan drug) legislation, passed in 1999, was to encourage drug companies to conduct research into rare diseases and develop novel treatments. However, as the rules are currently enacted, many drug companies merely address their efforts to licensing drugs that are already available rather than developing new treatments. Once a company has obtained a licence, the legislation then gives the company sole rights to supply the drug. This in turn allows the company to set an exorbitant price for this supply and effectively to bar previous suppliers of the unlicensed preparation from further production and distribution. 
 Similar regulatory loopholes (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colchicine#Marketing_exclusivity_in_the_United_States) have been used to raise the price of colchicine (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2010/04/14/colchicines_price_goes_through_the_roof) and hydroxyprogesterone (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2011/11/09/kv_pharmaceuticals_latest_makena_move) , among others, and we can expect this to be done over and over, with every single drug that it can be done to, because the supply of people who think that this is a good idea is apparently endless. And the public backlash and the regulatory (and legislative) scrutiny that this brings down will then be distributed not just to the rent-seeking generic companies involved, but to every drug company of any type, because whatever hits the fan is never evenly spread. Do we really want this? 
 Postscript: In an interesting sequel to the Retrophin story, the company's board this week replaced (http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-01/martin-shkreli-short-seller-who-started-retrophin-gets-fired) CEO Martin Shkreli, whose sudden appearance (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/09/12/thiola_retrophin_martin_shkrell_reddit_and_more) on Reddit in response to this issue probably didn't help his position).
