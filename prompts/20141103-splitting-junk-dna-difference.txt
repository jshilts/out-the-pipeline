Splitting the Junk DNA Difference
3 Nov 2014

A big dispute erupted in the genomics world in 2012 (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/09/13/encode_and_what_it_all_means) with the publication of the ENCODE consortium's data - and with their interpretation of it. How much of the human genome is functional? And just what does "functional" mean? The ENCODE folks, or at least many of them, claim that 70 or 80% of the genome has function, but there have been (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/03/15/more_encode_skepticism) some very strong dissents (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/02/25/encode_the_nastiest_dissent_ive_seen_in_quite_some_time) . (And on the other side of the issue, there have been some results that point to far more (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/07/01/corroboration_for_encode) coding regions in DNA, and for far more complex (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/04/18/superenhancers_in_cell_biology_encodes_revenge) regulation of it, than many had thought). 
 A lot of people in the drug discovery business are watching this fight closely, and picking sides. This all has to bear on how many drug targets there are (and on the possible advent of many new ones), and we care about that quite a bit. There's a new paper in PLOS Genetics (http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1004525) , though, that throws some more cold water on the lots-of-function idea, while at the same time adding much more function than the 1% that codes for proteins would indicate. Here's the authors' summary: 
 Nearly 99% of the human genome does not encode proteins, and while there recently has been extensive biochemical annotation of the remaining noncoding fraction, it remains unclear whether or not the bulk of these DNA sequences have important functional roles. By comparing the genome sequences of different species we identify genomic regions that have evolved unexpectedly slowly, a signature of natural selection upon functional sequence. Using a high resolution evolutionary approach to find sequence showing evolutionary signatures of functionality we estimate that a total of 8.2% (7.1–9.2%) of the human genome is presently functional, more than three times as much than is functional and shared between human and mouse. This implies that there is an abundance of sequences with short lived lineage-specific functionality. As expected, most of the sequence involved in this functional “turnover” is noncoding, while protein coding sequence is stably preserved over longer evolutionary timescales. More generally, we find that the rate of functional turnover varies significantly across categories of functional noncoding elements. . . 
 So that's about 9 times the DNA that flat-out codes for proteins, but about 10 times less than the high-end ENCODE number for function. Nature is under no obligation to split the difference in this manner, but this does sound like an appealing estimate. The differences in coding stability are intriguing as well: protein-coding DNA is under very tight control indeed, but some species-specific noncoding (but functional) regions change on a more rapid time scale. But a lot of the genome does appear to be under no particular constraint or selection pressure at all; it can do what it likes.
