3 Jan 2014

Via AndyBiotech on Twitter, here's a disturbing chart (https://twitter.com/AndyBiotech/status/413664719715983360/photo/1) of price trends of drugs in several therapeutics areas. Annualized, these are hikes of 10% or more per year. 
 Now, it seems clear that one big reason for this is that hey, insurance will pay for it. And no one needs to tell me (or most readers of this site) about the state of drug discovery and the corresponding need to make hay while the sun shines. I also think that companies should be able to charge what they think they can charge for their goods and services, and I would very much dislike (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/05/16/the_atlantic_on_drug_rd) handing over those decisions to some sort of review board that decides what the "right" prices should be. 
 But. . .(and it's a big "but", to use a phrase that sent my kids into floor-pounding hysterics when I used it inadvertently while trying to lecture them) there's another factor at work here. We've had a lot of discussions (https://www.science.org/pipeline/drug_prices/) about drug pricing around here, and one theme (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/04/29/costing_just_too_much) I've brought up several (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/07/30/cancer_drugs_value_for_the_money) times is that unless our business is seen as providing good value for the money, we are inviting the various hammers to come down on us.
