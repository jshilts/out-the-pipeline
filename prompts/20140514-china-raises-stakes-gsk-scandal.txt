China Raises the Stakes in the GSK Scandal
14 May 2014

GSK's troubles in China have just gotten even more serious (http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/05/14/uk-china-glaxosmithkline-idUKKBN0DU05I20140514) . The government has formally charged Mark Reilly, former head of the company's operations in China, of organizing and participating in a bribery scheme. This seems to have been a stronger step than people were expecting - we'll see what happens. Reilly's whereabouts do not seem to be clear to anyone - I would assume that he left China some time ago, but if he hasn't, then he's not leaving for some time to come.
