Thoughts on Overpublishing
18 Feb 2014

My recent memorial notice (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/02/17/alan_katritzky_19282014) for Alan Katritzky brought an interesting comment, by someone who did the math that I didn't. His total publication count actually seems to be (http://www.ark.chem.ufl.edu/Index.asp?View=Published_Papers/Publication_List.asp) 2215 papers published since 1953. That comes to one paper every ten days over sixty-one years . I have trouble even imagining that. This is a vast amount of work, both the chemistry and the writing, and it's a monument that very, very few people will leave behind them. 
 Should anyone, though? I mean no disrespect to Katritzky's memory by asking this question, let me note quickly. But I wrote about this here (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2006/06/28/part_nine_hundred_and_forty_two_in_a_series_) a few years ago, the idea that a person can, in fact, publish too many papers. My example then was H. C. Brown - I'm not sure how many papers he co-authored, but the figure is a large one and brings on similar thoughts. 
 There have been many scientists on the other end of the scale, going back to Isaac Newton, who had to be badgered into letting everyone know that he'd revolutionized physics. Lars Onsager is a good example from the physics/chemistry borderlands - there are stories told about the work he had stored away in his filing cabinets, a terrifying stockpile that most other people would have found very much to their credit to have published. This approach is clearly not the way to go, either - people don't have a chance to build on your work when they don't know about it, and others may spend a good amount of effort duplicating things when you could (and should) have saved them the effort. 
 But publishing thousands of papers doesn't seem like a good alternative, to be honest. People will have trouble sorting out the good parts, and they can't all be good parts. Time will settle that question, you might think, but time could bungle that job. Time has dropped the ball before. 
 Update: See Arr Oh did a very interesting list (http://justlikecooking.blogspot.com/2013/05/friday-fun-superlative-publishers.html) last year of the organic chemists who publish the most. Katritzky did indeed lead the field.
