I'll appreciate, in turn, that that opening sentence is likely to divide its readers into those who will read on and those who will see the words "SIRT1" or "Sinclair" and immediate seek their entertainment elsewhere. I feel for you, but this does look like an interesting paper, and it'll be worthwhile to see what comes of it. 
 Here's the Harvard press release (http://hms.harvard.edu/news/genetics/new-reversible-cause-aging-12-19-13) , which is fairly detailed, in case you don't have access to Cell . The mechanism they're proposing is that as NAD+ (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide) levels decline with age, this affects SIRT1 function to the point that it no longer constains HIF-1. Higher levels of HIF-1, in turn, disrupt pathways between the nucleus and the mitochondia, leading to lower levels of mitochondria-derived proteins, impaired energy generation, and cellular signs of aging. 
 Very interestingly, these effects were reversed (on a cellular/biomarker level) by one-week treatment of aging mice with NMN (nicotine mononucleotide edit: fixed typo) , a precursor to NAD. That's kind of a brute-force approach to the problem, but a team from Washington U. recently showed (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413111003469) extremely similar effects in aging diabetic rodents supplemented with NMN, done for exactly the same NAD-deficiency reasons. I would guess that the NMN is flying off the shelves down at the supplement stores, although personally I'll wait for some more in vivo work before I start taking it with my orange juice in the mornings. 
 Now, whatever you think of sirtuins (and of Sinclair's work with them), this work is definitely not crazy talk. Mitochondria function has long been a good place to look (http://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00424-009-0724-5) for cellular-level aging, and HIF-1 is an interesting connection as well. As many readers will know, that acronym stands for " hypoxia inducible factor (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia-inducible_factors) " - the protein was originally seen to be upregulated when cells were put under low-oxygen stress. It's a key regulatory switch for a number of metabolic pathways under those conditions, but there's no obvious reason for it to be getting more active just because you're getting older. Some readers may have encountered it as an oncology target - there are a number of tumors that show abnormal HIF activity. That makes sense, on two levels - the interiors of solid tumors are notoriously oxygen-poor, so that would at least be understandable, but switching on HIF under normal conditions is also bad news (http://www.biomedres.info/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/109-131-Edward_Sanders-corrected-Jan_26_2012.28224041.pdf) . It promotes glycolysis as a metabolic pathway, and stimulates growth factors for angiogenesis. Both of those are fine responses for a normal cell that needs more oxygen, but they're also the behavior (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2010/05/14/dca_and_cancer_more_results) of a cancer cell showing unrestrained growth. (And those cells have their tradeoffs, too, such as a possible switch (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2009/05/07/angiogenesis_inhibitors_helping_or_hurting) between metastasis and angiogenesis, which might also have a role for HIF). 
 There's long been speculation about a tradeoff between aging and cellular prevention of carcinogenicity. In this case, though, we might have a mechanism where our interests on on the same side: overactive HIF (under non-hypoxic conditions) might be a feature of both cancer cells and "normally" aging ones. I put that word in quotes because (as an arrogant upstart human) I'm not yet prepared to grant that the processes of aging that we undergo are the ones that we have to undergo. My guess is that there's been very little selection pressure on lifespan, and that what we've been dealt is the usual evolutionary hand of cards: it's a system that works well enough to perpetuate the species and beyond that who cares? 
 Well, we care. Biochemistry is a wonderful, heartbreakingly intricate system whose details we've nowhere near unraveled, and we often mess it up when we try to do anything to it, anyway. But part of what makes us human is the desire (and now the ability) to mess around with things like this when we think we can benefit. Not looking at the mechanisms of aging seems to me like not looking at the mechanisms of, say, diabetes, or like letting yourself die of a bacterial infection when you could take an antibiotic. Just how arrogant that attitude is, I'm not sure yet. I think we'll eventually get the chance to find out. All this recent NAD work suggests that we might get that chance sooner than later. Me, I'm 51. Speed the plow (http://www.ibiblio.org/fiddlers/speed.htm) .
