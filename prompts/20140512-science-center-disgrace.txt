When my family and lived in the area, we used to take the kids there, in the old facility. As of 2009, they have a new building in downtown Hartford, which I haven't seen personally, but if this is the sort of science they've filled it with, I haven't missed much. Update: turns out that this new building is a new organization, different from the older site in West Hartford. Readers also tell me that this is from from the only nonsensical chemical decoration to be found inside the place. 
 What gets me about this sort of thing is (1) how idiotic it is and (2) how avoidable it is. That structure is probably the worst fake chemical drawing I've ever seen - it makes no sense, in several different directions at once, and anyone who knows chemistry will feel like spitting on the floor after seeing it. And it would have taken the decorator about five minutes to come up something real instead. 
 But that, I guess, is what really gets me about this sort of thing. It's the attitude: close enough, right? Who's going to notice, a bunch of geeks? 'Sall the same, anyway, buncha lines and chemically-stuff. If someone had a display up about (say) Thailand, but the people in the video display were just gabbling funny noises instead of speaking Thai, there would be complaints. If a wall featured a background illustration of a map of the world, with the countries mislabeled and some of the letters backwards, there would be complaints. And there should be complaints about this, and by golly, this is one right here. The Connecticut Science Center should demonstrate that it actually gives a flying *&!# about science, and fix this. And perhaps they should check the other exhibits while they're at it, to make sure that the same decorative flair hasn't been applied to them as well. 
 Update: Good news! The Science Center has now said that they apologize for the bad chemistry, and that the graphics are being removed. About the author Derek Lowe (https://www.science.org/content/author/derek-lowe) View more (#) Comments IN THE PIPELINE
