DMSO Will Ruin Your Platinum Drugs. Take Heed.
12 May 2014

Here's the sort of experimental detail that can destroy a whole project if you're not aware of it. The platinum chemotherapy drugs are an odd class of things compared to the more typical organic compounds, but it's for sure that many of the people using them in research aren't aware of all of their peculiarities. One of those has been highlighted recently (http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/lookup/doi/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-0247) , and it's a sneaky one. 
 DMSO is, of course, the standard solvent (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2008/05/20/the_miracle_solvent) used to take up test compounds for pharmacological assays. It's water-miscible and dissolves a huge range of organic compounds. Most of the time (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2004/01/08/a_request_from_biology) it's fine (unless you push its final concentration too high in the assay). But it's most definitely not fine for the platinum complexes. This paper shows that DMSO displaces the starting ligands, forming a new platinum complex that does not show the desired activity in cells. What's more, a look through the literature shows that up to one third of the reported in vitro studies on these compounds used DMSO to dissolve them, which throws their conclusions immediately into doubt. And since nearly half the papers did not even mention the solvent used, you'd have to think that DMSO showed up a good amount of the time in those as well. 
 What's even more disturbing is that these sorts of problems were first reported over twenty years ago , but it's clear that this knowledge has not made it into general circulation. So the word needs to get out: never dissolve cisplatin (or the related complexes) in DMSO, even though that might seem like the obvious thing to do. Editors and referees should take note as well.
