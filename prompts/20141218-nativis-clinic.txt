Nativis In the Clinic
18 Dec 2014

Time to revisit an old favorite around here. Remember Nativis Pharmaceuticals? I do, since they provided one of my most treasured (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2010/06/10/nativis_in_which_the_distant_footfalls_of_lawyers_can_be_heard) "you can expect legal action" letters. When last mentioned (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/02/22/nativis_returns) here, they were working on the "Voyager", a device (used in veterinary care at the time of that post) that would somehow play back some sort of radio signature of a drug solution and therefore affect the course of a disease. I have not, despite a few efforts, arrived at a better description than that of what Nativis says that they do. 
 Well, a correspondent alerts me to this clinical trial (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02296580) : Nativis apparently intends to try this out on human patients with glioblastoma. They have also published this paper (http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperInformation.aspx?paperID=51105#.VJMRMsAACI) a bit earlier in the fall - it describes the recording of a radio signature of a taxane in solution, and the subsequent effect of broadcasting this into a tubulin polymerization assay. I will note that the publisher of the open-access journal this this appears in is not known (http://scholarlyoa.com/2014/12/16/the-chinese-publisher-scirp-scientific-research-publishing-a-publishing-empire-built-on-junk-science/) for their quality (http://scholarlyoa.com/2014/07/31/is-scientific-research-publishing-scirp-publishing-pseudo-science/) . To put it mildly (http://scholarlyoa.com/2014/04/29/fallout-from-questionable-article-in-oa-pediatrics-journal/) . 
 My correspondent tells me (and I have no way of knowing this firsthand) that Nativis has been raising money from its private investors in advance of this clinical trial. We'll see if it gets off the ground. I await the results with more than average interest.
