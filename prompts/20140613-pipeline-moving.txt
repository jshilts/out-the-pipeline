"In the Pipeline" Will Be Moving
13 Jun 2014

Everyone who's visited the blog in the last few weeks has noticed the ongoing server problems. I've been working on solutions, and I think that the time has come to move the blog. I've had offers over the years to do so, but for one reason or another, I haven't made the jump. But several very good situations have been offered to me recently, and one way or another, it looks like I'll be picking up stakes soon. 
 Corante.com has been this blog's home for over ten years now, and it's been quite a run. I am extremely grateful to Hylton Joliffe, the man behind it, for all the effort and for the space to do whatever I wanted to do here. Looking back, I can't believe how much I've written over that time (the archives will be moving too). But I plan to keep going without interruption, and I'll have more details soon about the new location.
