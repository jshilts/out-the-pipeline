Dacomitinib Doesn't Come Through
28 Jan 2014

Lest you think that it's only small companies that wipe out in Phase III oncology trials, consider Pfizer's news yesterday (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/top-pfizer-drug-flops-two-phiii-lung-cancer-studies/2014-01-27) about dacomitinib. Two Phase III studies in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) missed their endpoints, a real problem for a compound that was supposed to be one of the showpieces of the company oncology portfolio. 
 The compound ( structure here (http://www.selleckchem.com/products/pf299804.html) ) is another of the current crop of irreversible kinase inhibitors (which is one reason why 2013's crop of approved drugs looked a bit odd (http://cen.acs.org/articles/92/i4/Year-New-Drugs.html) ). In this case, it's picking up Cys773, on the edge of the ATP binding pocket. The compound hits across the HER kinase family, and we have now found out that that's not enough for this variety of lung cancer, at any rate. It had looked more promising (http://www.jthoracdis.com/article/view/586/html) in Phase II (don't they all), so we can assume that a lot of what-went-wronging has been going on at Pfizer, both to keep from repeating this experience and to figure out if there are some identifiable patient subsets that might be worth following up on. 
 Even if there are, dacomitinib is not going to be the drug that Pfizer hoped for. That drug would have hit the survival endpoints in these two trials.
