Knockout Models
5 Nov 2014

Did you know that we already have a supply of human genetic knockout models for disease? No, they haven't been generated in an underground lab in North Korea; they're walking around everywhere as part of the natural genetic variability of our species. And it's now feasible to track them down, as thisNature Newsarticle (http://www.nature.com/news/geneticists-tap-human-knockouts-1.16239) Nature News shows. 
 Geneticists discussed several such large-scale efforts during a packed session at the American Society of Human Genetics meeting in San Diego, California, last week. “So much of what we know is based on mice and rats, and not humans,” says Daniel MacArthur, a genomicist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, whose team identified around 200,000 variants that naturally knocked out genes by trawling the protein-coding portion of the genome, or exome, in more than 90,000 people. “Now we can find people who actually have a particular gene inactivated or somehow modified, and that allows us to test hypotheses directly.” 
 Some of these human loss-of-function mutations are harmful, of course (here's a large compendium (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1444112252/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1444112252&linkCode=as2&tag=lagniappe-20&linkId=IGTNWKYXNGVSRQVA) of them), but some of them are actually helpful. Both of them are well worth tracking down, and sequencing has cheapened to the point that large-scale fishing expeditions are feasible. 
 Some surprising things are turning up. The article notes that ". . .a team from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Hinxton, UK, reported that 43 genes whose inactivation is lethal to mice were found to be inactivated in humans who are alive and apparently well." . You're not going to find that out any other way. Even if we get to the point of gene inactivation therapies in humans (and we will), no one's going to line up to start trying lethal mouse knockouts just to see what happens. Not unless we get some sort of well-funded Dr. Mengele, anyway, and spare us from that. 
 I would predict that gene sequencing will become a check-off option (or perhaps the default, to be opted out of) for people seeking medical treatment. There are privacy concerns, of course, and there will be screwups. There will also be a lot of red herrings and misinterpretation: larger data sets will keep some of that from happening, but will enable it in other areas. But there's a vast amount to be learned, and large-scale genomic studies (larger than anything to date) are going to be the only way to learn a lot of it. 
 As an aside, I'll be watching closely to see if my choice of headline drives some more traffic - disappointed traffic - to this post. It's a joke that I've used with my wife before ("Oh, just checking out some good-looking models"), but she's used to me. Mostly. My personal favorite was when our kids were younger and we were visiting a farm that had several breeds of chickens. As we got to hold some of them, I turned to my wife and said "Just another weekend, out picking up chicks".
