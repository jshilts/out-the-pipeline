A Ligand Efficiency Reply
13 May 2014

The inevitable reply (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ml500146d) to the Schulz paper (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/08/22/too_many_metrics) on the validity (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/09/04/more_thoughts_on_compound_metrics) of ligand efficiency measurements has appeared in ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters . Sent in from a number of prominent fragment chemists at Astex, Carmot, Dundee, GSK, the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and Gfree, it takes the earlier paper to task in a number of ways: 
 (The earlier article) states that LE and related metrics “violate the quotient rule of logarithms” and “appear plausible but are mathematical impossibilities”. 
 The primary purpose of our viewpoint article is to correct these mathematical statements and prevent them from propagating through the literature. We also examine the behavior of LE and lipophilic ligand eﬃciency (LLE) for two matched chemical pairs and compare this with a simple example of fuel eﬃciency. Finally we brieﬂy consider genuine deﬁciencies of LE metrics so as to put valid criticism into perspective. 
 They start off by coming to the same conclusion that I did here (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/02/19/ligand_efficiency_a_response_to_shultz.php) - that there's nothing wrong with dividing a log by an integer, and that it's rather odd to think that there is. They also respond to one of Shultz's other objections, that LE needs to remain constant for each heavy atom that increases potency, by saying, essentially, that no it doesn't. Changes are larger on smaller molecules, and this has to be realized by anyone working with these metrics. I might note that the same thing happens with logP, and indeed with plain old molecular weight, if you think of it on a percentage basis: adding a trifluoromethyl (for example) is a bigger change on a smaller molecule in both those departments. 
 Another part of the Shultz paper was his admiration for LLE as a measure of ligand efficiency. The current authors agree that it's useful, but add this: 
 Lipophilicity is an extremely important quantity to control 
 during optimization, and Shultz rightly extols the virtues of LLE. LLE explicitly considers the balance of lipophilicity with potency and can be very useful in comparing HTS hits or during lead optimization. However, despite its strengths, it can be diﬃcult to use LLE in comparing molecules of very diﬀerent sizes and potencies. Also LLE will be less useful where the target requires very polar molecules. . . 
 They finish up by saying the Shulz makes some valid points (along with some invalid ones), but that his viewpoint article is rendered less useful by a tone that is "sometimes unhelpful to effective debate". I've been known to take some unhelpful tones myself in the past, so I have no particular standing in discussing that part of things, but for what it's worth, I agree with Shulz that far too many compound metrics have been proposed. I disagree with him that most of them are somehow mathematically invalid, but I agree that some of them are bound to be more useful than others. And I agree with the current paper that there's no such thing as a single one-size-fits-all compound metric, and that medicinal chemists (and their managers!) are just going to have to learn to deal with that. 
 Update: here's the post on this (http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2014/05/in-defense-of-ligand-efficiency-and-poll.html) at Practical Fragments, where they're also taking a poll on what metrics people actually use.
