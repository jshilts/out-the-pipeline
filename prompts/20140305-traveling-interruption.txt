Traveling Interruption
5 Mar 2014

My visit to Illinois went well, and I had a very good time talking to the students and faculty here in Champaign/Urbana. But American Airlines has decided not to fly anyone to Chicago today, so I've had to round up alternative transportation and reschedule flights, which isn't going to leave much time for blogging, from the looks of it. So normal service, or what passes for it around here, will resume on Thursday! 
 Update: traveling interruption is right. I was supposed to fly out of Champaign at 8 AM, go through O'Hare, and land in Boston at 1:45. As mentioned above, that 8 AM flight disappeared, so I took a shuttle bus up to Chicago - which, because of the snow and thick traffic, ended up taking over four hours to get to ORD. But I was still in time for my rebooked flight - if American hadn't rebooked me for that flight departing Thursday instead of Wednesday. The guy at the airport desk was as puzzled as I was about why anyone would do that, but got me on direct flight to Boston leaving at 1:20. Which was delayed. And delayed again. I did finally make it back to Logan close to 6 PM, feeling a bit as if I'd made the trip back on a pogo stick! I know that ORD is capable of far more than this, though, and I'm glad that I escaped any worse fate .
