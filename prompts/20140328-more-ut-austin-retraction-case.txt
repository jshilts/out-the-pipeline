More on the UT-Austin Retraction Case
28 Mar 2014

I mentioned an unusual retraction (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/08/28/a_synthetic_retraction) from Organic Letters here last year, and here's some follow-up (http://www.statesman.com/news/news/state-regional/ut-graduate-accused-of-falsifying-data-sues-to-kee/nfJGw/) to the story: 
 Nearly six years after Suvi Orr received a Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Texas, the university told her it has decided to do something that institutions of higher learning almost never do: revoke 
 the degree. Orr, in turn, has sued UT in an effort to hold onto the doctorate that launched her career in the pharmaceutical industry. 
 Her lawsuit in state district court in Travis County contends that revocation is unwarranted and that the university violated her rights by not letting her defend herself before the dissertation committee that condemned her research long after she graduated. In addition, she says, the committee relied heavily on her former professor, who, she claims, was motivated to “cast the blame elsewhere.” 
 What a mess. More details as things develop. . .
