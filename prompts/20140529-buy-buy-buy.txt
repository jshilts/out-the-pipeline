How to Buy, Buy, Buy

I really got a kick out of " The Seven Deadly Sins of Biotech Investing (http://www.thestreet.com/story/12725934/1/the-seven-deadly-sins-of-biotech-investing.html) ", sent to Adam Feuerstein by one of his readers. It's a sort of Screwtape Letters/Devil's Dictionary look at the sector, with gems of wisdom like this: 
 Find a good Internet message board to discuss how great an investment the biotech stock you just purchased really is. When spending time on this message board, be sure to read closely all posts from those who are the most vocal proponents of the biotech stock you own. These people demonstrate their commitment by never writing anything critical. No one wants to attend a church where the preacher has doubts. The best posters will write at length about how the science behind the biotech stock you own has no rival and will completely change the world we live in. Lucky for you the world does not know this yet; you are one of a select few! 
 No other part of the market seems to attract wildly devoted cultists like small biopharma stocks do; it's really something to see. And they must keep spawning, because many of them end up getting blown up, big-time, by their favorite stocks, only to be replaced by another cohort of true believers. This is one of the things that blows them up, by the way: 
 In the unlikely event that the biotech stock you just bought falls in value, it's a clear indication of an attack by the shorts. If this happens, check in with your favorite Internet message board. There, you will likely find a link to a negative article written by a reporter or blogger who is clearly getting paid to shill for the short-selling hedge funds. These are bad people trying to steal your shares without doing the proper DD you did. The best way to fight a coordinated short attack is to buy more shares of the biotech stock you just bought. Keep buying. 
 As Groucho Marx said while peddling Florida swampland in "The Cocoanuts", "You can get any kind of house you want - you can even get stucco!" (and to one side, "Boy, can you get stucko!")
