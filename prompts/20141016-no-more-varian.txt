No More Varian
16 Oct 2014

This week has brought news that Agilent is getting out of the NMR business (http://www.agilent.com/about/newsroom/presrel/2014/14oct-gp14028.html) , which brings an end to the Varian line of machines, one of the oldest (http://www.ray-freeman.org/nmr-history.html#sec08) in the business. (Agilent bought Varian in 2010). The first NMR I ever used was a Varian EM-360, which was the workhorse teaching instrument back then. A full 60 MHz of continuous wave for your resolving pleasure - Fourier transform? Superconducting magnets? Luxury! Why, we used to dream of. . . 
 I used many others in the years to come. But over time, the number of players in the NMR hardware market has contracted. You used to be able to walk into a good-sized NMR room and see machines from Varian, Bruker, JEOL, Oxford, GE (edit - added them) and once in a while an oddity like the 80-MHz IBM-brand machine (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/07/26/instrument_nostalgia) that I used to use at Duke thirty years ago. No more - Bruker is now the major player. Their machines are good ones (and they've been in the business a while, too (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2010/10/22/the_latest_technology) ), but I do wish that they had some competition to keep them on their toes. 
 How come there isn't any? It's not that NMR spectroscopy is a dying art. It's as useful as ever, if not even more so. But I think that the market for equipment is pretty saturated. Every big company and university has plenty of capacity, and will buy a new machine only once in a while. The smaller companies are usually fixed pretty well, too, thanks to the used equipment market. And most of those colleges that used to have something less than a standard 300 MHz magnet have worked their way up to one. 
 There's not much room for a new company to come in and say that their high-field magnets are so much better than the existing ones, either, because the hardware has also reached something of a plateau. You can go out and buy a 700 MHz instrument (and Bruker no doubt wishes that you would), and that's enough to do pretty much any NMR experiment that you can think of. 1000 MHz instruments exist, but I'm not sure how many times you run into a situation where one of those would do the job for you, but a 700 wouldn't. I'm pretty sure that no one even knows how to build a 2000 MHz NMR, but if they did, the number sold would probably be countable on the fingers of one hand. Someone would have to invent a great reason for such a machine to exist -this isn't supercomputing, where the known applications can soak up all the power you can throw at them. 
 So farewell to the line of Varian NMR machines. Generations of chemists have used their equipment, but Bruker is the one left standing.
