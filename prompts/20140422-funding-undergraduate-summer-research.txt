Funding Undergraduate Summer Research
22 Apr 2014

I wanted to mention another crowdfunded organic chemistry effort, this one on a small (and useful) scale. A former colleague of mine, Brent Chandler, is an assistant professor of chemistry (http://www.ic.edu/RelId/613677/ISvars/default/Faculty_in_Chemistry.htm) at Illinois College, and he's working with undergraduates in organic synthesis. At the moment, he's trying to get funding for a summer undergraduate to work on a new synthesis of muscone (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscone) . Synthesis of these macrocyclic musk compounds has only recently become economical at all, and prices are still high, so there's an opportunity. 
 I got my own start in the business as a summer undergrad back in 1981 at Hendrix College, and it was a great experience. The Indiegogo site for this effort is here (https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/save-the-musk-deer#home) . Chandler is trying to find an economical route to muscone, to train a young chemist, and to demonstrate to his institution that this can be a viable way to fund targeted research projects. We'll see how it works out!
