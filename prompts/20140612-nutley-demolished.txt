Nutley Demolished
12 Jun 2014

For those who worked at, visited, or remember the Hoffman-LaRoche site in Nutley, here's what the end of the line (http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2014/06/roche_markets_5_buildings_on_nutley_campus_razing_the_rest.html) looks like. After closing it as an R&D facility, the company is now putting five of the buildings on the market, and tearing down the rest. The remaining buildings look to be picked up by smaller biopharma, according to the article, and it'll be interesting to see who that might be. The rest of the property will probably be turned into office and retail space. 
 The first research site I ever worked at (Schering-Plough in Bloomfield, NJ) was torn down when the company moved everyone to Kenilworth. Many attempts were made to sell the labs to some other research organization, but no one wanted it. I believe that they also looked into donating it to Rutgers, but it was like giving someone a pet elephant (no thanks, just on the maintenance costs). So in the end, everything was demolished, and a Home Depot (and its parking lot) occupy a lot of that land now. And there are many other Phormer Pharma sites scattered around the US and Europe now (with New Jersey having a generous share of them).
