 See Arr Oh brings news (http://justlikecooking.blogspot.com/2014/11/friday-fun-maitotoxin-watch.html) that the Nicolaou group has published (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja509829e) another piece of maitotoxin (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maitotoxin) . This has been going on for some years now (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2010/04/26/maitotoxin_revisited) , and looks to go one for a few more. 
 To remind everyone, that's the structure of maitotoxin. Readers can decide for themselves which parts of the molecule they find most useful, and which ones they most look forward to reading about the synthesis of. My own opinion was set some time ago, quite a bit of it after I finished up my own total-synthesis-based PhD work.
