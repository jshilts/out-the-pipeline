Valuing Biotech Startups
11 Jun 2014

Via Bruce Booth on Twitter, here's an in-depth look at the financing of small biotechs, compared to the financing of internet and IT-centric startups. As everyone knows, many of the latter companies are able to raise staggering amounts of money, far more than the best-funded biotech startups have ever seen. But the comparisons across financing rounds are quite instructive. 
 Biopharma startups raise more in each round in a steady and undramatic fashion (well, when there are more rounds of financing, but you know what I mean). The tech startups are more volatile, and show big money at first, followed by shakeouts later on. That makes sense. A small pharma company starts off with an idea that has enough data behind it (and enough potential) to bring in enough money to see if it can go any further. If it can, it raises more money to try to clear another (higher) bar, and so on. Tech startups often begin with a flashy idea that is much better suited to attract a lot of interest, and it's often the sort of idea that needs to be moved on quickly if it's going to work at all. So hopeful money floods in at the beginning, and the reality checks only come at a later stage. 
 There are sound financial reasons for things to work out this way, too - biopharma is a capital-intensive business, and failure rates are (of course) rather high: 
 The best biotech exit (IPOs and M&As) over the past 5 years by valuation (in this case pre-money at the time of IPO) has been Ironwood (unlikely name!) at $1B. If we look at M&A upfronts, Plexxikon tops the charts at $805M. The median 5x cash-on-cash M&A upfront exit, generally regarded as top decile return in biotech, has been $240M (average at $286M) since 2010. A few biotech IPOs of the 2013-14 vintage are currently above that level, although as discussed elsewhere on this blog, much of those are unrealized returns. Big picture, if I’m a Series A VC I come in knowing that I’ll likely be putting in $50M+ with my syndicate for an exit likely capped around $300M (can’t be too aggressive with my assumptions as a VC!)- as such, it doesn’t make sense to hold the companies at a carrying value much above cost if I want to target a 3x return for my fund knowing 7 out of 10 companies in my portfolio will go belly up. 
 Small tech companies have an even higher failure rate than biotech ones, but the valuations can get so insane for the successful exits (hundredfold or more) that putting in more money isn't a crazy strategy. There is no biotech equivalent to the sort of return that a Facebook, Über, Twitter or Paypal can provide.
