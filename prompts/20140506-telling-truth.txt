It's an edited version of a talk he gave recently at NYU, and he's telling the audience exactly what it's really like: 
 But the successes are rare, so we have to talk more about our lack of knowledge – our ignorance. 
 Ignorance afflicts all aspects of medicine. We are starting from a very primitive state. Medicine today is reactive and myopic. We go to the doctor when we are sick (reactive), and the doctor has very few tools with which to study our illness (myopic). 
 And we simply don’t know enough about how the human body works – it is not clear exactly how most medicines work. Two molecules that differ only by a few atoms may have very different effects in the body. One may be a life-saving drug while the other is a poison. 
 So what exactly do we mean by “ignorance”? Prof Stuart Firestein of Columbia University points out that “ignorance” is not a criticism; it simply reflects the fact that we scientists, as a community, lack a great deal of fundamental knowledge. 
 If I had to pick one thing that the general public doesn't realize about drug discovery, or medicine in general, this would probably be the one I'd pick. It's the root cause of our scientific difficulties, and the root of a lot of suspicion and misunderstanding from others. The mass of knowledge we've accumulated about biochemistry and disease looks so huge and imposing, even if you understand a lot of it. Now imagine how it looks if you never cared much for the chemistry and biology that you had in school. So it has to be enough to fix diseases, right? And if there aren't any cures available, it sort of has to be because of laziness, greed, or evil conspiracies, then - right? 
 So I'm always glad to see talks like this one being given (and Murcko is eminently qualified to do it). It's another reason that I have this blog, and when I hear from people outside of drug discovery (and outside of science in general), telling me that they never knew X or Y or Z, it makes my day.
