Scripps Update
21 Jun 2014

I'm told now that after a number of faculty at the Scripps Research Institute have objected (http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/jun/20/scrippsresearch-USC/) to the proposed deal with USC, that UC-San Diego is ready to explore some sort of merger deal. Going down North Torrey Pines Road would seem to be logistically easier than going to Los Angeles, but there are other considerations as well. This could go on for a while!
