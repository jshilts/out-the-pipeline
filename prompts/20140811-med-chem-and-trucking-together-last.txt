Med-Chem and Trucking, Together At Last
11 Aug 2014

One of my standard lines (in presentations or lab conversation), when referring to some research that just flat-out isn't working, is that I should chuck it all and go to truck-driving school just like my mother always wanted. (She actually didn't, in case you're wondering!) 
 The similarities between organic chemistry and truck driving may be closer than they appear, though. Try this blog post (http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/upshot/the-trucking-industry-needs-more-drivers-it-should-try-paying-more.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&smid=tw-upshot&_r=0) at the New York Times out. The title alone will send you right into crippling-STEM-shortage land: "The Trucking Industry Needs More Drivers. Maybe It Needs to Pay More." 
 Consider this: The American Trucking Associations has estimated that there was a shortage of 30,000 qualified drivers earlier this year, a number on track to rise to 200,000 over the next decade. Trucking companies are turning down business for want of workers. 
 Yet the idea that there is a huge shortage of truck drivers flies in the face of a jobless rate of more than 6 percent, not to mention Economics 101. The most basic of economic theories would suggest that when supply isn’t enough to meet demand, it’s because the price — in this case, truckers’ wages — is too low. Raise wages, and an ample supply of workers should follow. 
 But corporate America has become so parsimonious about paying workers outside the executive suite that meaningful wage increases may seem an unacceptable affront. In this environment, it may be easier to say “There is a shortage of skilled workers” than “We aren’t paying our workers enough,” even if, in economic terms, those come down to the same thing. 
 Considering the sorts of speeches that Lilly's John Lechleiter gives (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/02/13/jobs_he_says) , this sounds familiar indeed. And the same things has come up in many of the "STEM shortage" discussions around here (https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=site:pipeline.corante.com+stem+shortage&safe=off) . A minor adjustment might be "We can't find people who will work for what we're paying our outsourced contractors", but the principle is pretty much the same.
