Another Whack at the Cost of Drugs Issue
1 May 2014

I wanted to highlight this post (http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/the-curious-wavefunction/2014/04/24/drug-costs-and-prices-here-we-go-again/) by Wavefunction on drug pricing. He's addressing the peole who want to know how come a drug with $X of ingredients in it can sell for some multiple of that price, and I'm glad he's making the effort. That's a tough crowd to convince (I've taken several swings (https://www.science.org/pipeline/drug_prices/) at the same topic myself). He emphasizes the difference between the cost of manufacturing something versus the cost of discovering it, which is exactly right, but the people arguing about this issue will usually dispute any realistic estimate of those discovery costs as well. But it's a point that has to be made. It's not that there's no way that a drug could ever be priced too high. It's just that they can also be priced too low.
