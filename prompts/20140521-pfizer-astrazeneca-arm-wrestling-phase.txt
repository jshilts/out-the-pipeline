Pfizer/AstraZeneca: The Arm-Wrestling Phase
21 May 2014

Don't forget - you can bet that the people at AstraZeneca aren't forgetting - that Pfizer still has until May 26th under UK securities law for their takeover offer. Today's Wall Street Journal reports (http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303749904579575543066735038?mg=reno64-wsj&url=/cms/10.1126/blog-post.3995/asset/http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702303749904579575543066735038.html) that some institutional investors are pressuring AZ's board to accept the offer (or at least open negotiations), while others are standing with the company's management. (Here's a summary (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/swelling-ranks-astrazenecas-dissident-shareholders-press-pfizer-deal/2014-05-21) at FierceBiotech if you don't have WSJ access). My guess is that the current deal won't go through, but if there's any mis-step in AZ's turnaround plans during the rest of the year, Pfizer will be right back at the door.
