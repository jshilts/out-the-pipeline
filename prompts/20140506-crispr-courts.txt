CRISPR In the Courts
6 May 2014

Here's an article (http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/scientific-split--the-human-genome-breakthrough-dividing-former-colleagues-9300456.html?asfg) from the Independent on the legal battles that are underway about CRISPR (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR) technology. On one level, it can be a somewhat ugly story, but it also shows how much (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/09/05/crispr_takes_off) of a discovery the technique has been, that people are willing to fight for the rights to it so vigorously. But it's going to take a lot of straightening out: 
 On the one side is a consortium of world-class researchers led by French-born Professor Emmanuelle Charpentier who made a key discovery behind the Crispr gene editing technique and has been promised $25m (£16m) by a group of venture capitalists to commercialise her invention for medical use. 
 On the other side is her former colleague and the co-discoverer of the gene-editing process, Professor Jennifer Doudna of the University of California, Berkeley, who has joined a rival consortium of researchers with $43m in venture capital to advance the Crispr technique into the clinic. 
 Each group has recruited a formidable panel of senior scientists as advisers. The Charpentier team, called Crispr Therapeutics, includes Nobel Laureate Craig Mello, the co-discoverer of a gene-silencing technique known as RNAi, and Daniel Anderson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was the first person to show that Crispr can cure a genetic disease in an adult animal. 
 Meanwhile the Doudna team, known as Editas Medicine, includes the Harvard geneticist George Church, a pioneer in synthetic biology, and Feng Zhang of MIT and the Broad Institute, who successfully managed to get Crispr to work in human cells and was this month awarded the first US patent on the technique – much to the dismay of Professor Charpentier. 
 Another crack (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/02/03/the_return_of_gene_therapy_and_more) at human gene therapy, that's one of the biggest engines driving all this. I hope that the legal wrangling doesn't slow that down. . .
