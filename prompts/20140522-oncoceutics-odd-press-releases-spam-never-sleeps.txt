Oncoceutics' Odd Press Releases (Spam Never Sleeps)
22 May 2014

That last entry (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/05/22/a_horrible_expensive_and_completely_avoidable_drug_development_mixup) about Oncoceutics attracted a comment that caught my eye. If you go to the company's web site, and their press release page (http://oncoceutics.com/news/press-releases/) , there are some oddities. Somehow, the same robo-spammers who infect the comment sections of blogs have worked their way into the text of the company's press releases. Here are some examples (emphasis added): 
 "There are also claims for ONC201 to be used in combination with other anticancer drugs and to be given orally to generic cialis cheap treat brain cancers. " 
 "To the extent that statements in this press release are cialis online generic not strictly historical, including statements as to revenue projections, business strategy, outlook, objectives, future milestones, plans, intentions. . ." 
 "“We are very pleased that the patent cheap viagra canada was issued in less than two years,” said Martin Stogniew, PhD, Chief Development Officer of Oncoceutics." 
 "“ONC201 is an exciting small molecule that has demonstrated efficacy against therapy-resistant malignancies and has shown to possess therapeutically desirable properties such as oral activity, thermal stability, temporally sustained activity, ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, and Cure Male viagra online cheap Impotence – How to Cure Erectile Dysfunction safety, ” said Wafik El-Deiry, MD, PhD FACP, co-founder and Chief Scientific Advisor of Oncoceutics." 
 OK, you get the idea, but there are plenty more where those came from. The company might want to clean this stuff up, and figure out how it got into all their press releases in the first place. 
 Update: the cleaning has taken place! Same-day service. . .
