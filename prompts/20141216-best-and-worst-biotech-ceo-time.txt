Best and Worst Biotech CEO Time
16 Dec 2014

I always enjoy Adam Feuerstein's voting for Best (http://www.thestreet.com/story/12982828/1/the-nominees-for-best-biotechnology-co-ceo-of-2014-are.html) and Worst (http://www.thestreet.com/story/12984012/1/nominees-for-absolute-worst-bio-technology-ceos-of-2014-are-.html) CEO in the biotech industry. But just as number of people who've read Dante's Inferno far outnumber the ones who've read the Paradisio (I'm a halfway through the Purgatorio guy myself), I suspect that more people read and vote on the Worst CEO part. There are some truly worthy nominees in that category, and you will find it hard to choose among them.
