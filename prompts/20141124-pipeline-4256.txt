Holiday Blogging
24 Nov 2014

I'm doing research today and tomorrow, but after that I'll be taking the rest of the week off, so blogging will be intermittent. Wednesday I'll be home making the traditional chocolate pecan pie ( recipe here (http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/2010/11/24/holiday_organic_synthesis_chocolate_pecan_pie) , with many helpful suggestions in the comment section), along with some of the other Thanksgiving food that can be prepared ahead of time. The menu this year will be the same as last year (http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/2013/11/27/thanksgiving_never_trust_an_organic_chemist_who_cant_cook.php) , by popular demand. 
 After consulting my wife and her mother, I'll see if I can post a recipe for the Iranian rice dish ( javaher polow ) that we serve along with everything. Problem is, it seems that Iranian food is one of those cuisines that varies so much from region to region (and household to household) that it's hard to put up a recipe without causing a fight of some sort. The closest situation to that in America is with barbecue - what one part of the country considers the pinnacle of the art would be rated as the next thing to cannibalism somewhere else. And so it is with Iranians. Common phrases include "Oh, well, so-and-so doesn't know how to cook (Dish X) the right way", or "They don't know how to make any decent (insert whole swath of cuisine) in (insert Iranian city or region), anyway". Add in some "Well, you used to be able to get good (type of food), but you can't any more", and I can see how my Southern upbringing blends with my wife's Iranian one pretty smoothly. But about the food we make at home, ourselves, I have no dispute at all!
