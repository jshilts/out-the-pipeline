Luc Montagnier Makes His Case in Paris
24 Sep 2014

Well, if you're in Paris next month and want to see some scientific (or perhaps not so scientific?) fireworks at a seminar, here's the event (http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/events/unesco-house/?tx_browser_pi1%5bshowUid%5d=29160&cHash=a17e72877b) to attend. UNESCO is holding a symposium on the work of Luc Montagnier on his "water memory" studies. I've mentioned this (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2011/01/10/has_luc_montagnier_lost_it) (and some of his other. . . unusual (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/05/29/luc_montagnier_is_not_losing_it_luc_montagnier_has_lost_it) . . .claims) here before (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2011/01/25/weirdness_montagnier_again_teleporting_dna) , and well. . .it's hard for me to say this, but they are indistinguishable from the work of a crank. Or someone with an unfortunate mental condition. I'm sure that Montagnier gets these kinds of responses all the time, and he obviously is strong enough to keep going with what he believes to be real results, so I have to give him credit for that. But extraordinary claims and extraordinary evidence, you know, and I haven't seen much of the latter. 
 The mathematician Cédric Villani, who received the Fields Medal in 2010, will propose a synthesis of the various presentations. He will include them in the broader context of Professor Jacques Benveniste’s work (1935-2004) on the "memory of water", which was initiated thirty years ago. 
 Professor Montagnier’s team is working on electromagnetic waves emitted in the area of very low frequencies and thus of low energy. Different reproducible experiments will be presented at the conference. These experiments show that these waves may play an important role in the pathogenicity of micro-organisms - bacteria and viruses – and also in physiological processes such as stem cell differentiation shown by Professor Carlo Ventura. 
 The experimental facts will be presented by the two biologists. It appears that water is an important mediator in the transmission of molecular information, such as that carried by DNA. To achieve such transmission, water generates organized structures, which also emit electromagnetic signals. Marc Henry and Giuseppe Vitiello, relying on concepts developed by Italian physicists Giuliano Preparata and Emilio Del Giudice, will explain how quantum physics can elucidate these mysterious phenomena. They will reveal new fields of research that are areas of consistency activating water molecules. Interdisciplinarity (physics/biology) is the conference’s major message. 
 The promoters of this conference are aware of the critical reactions aroused by this work in parts of the scientific community, so they wish to communicate their results with the utmost rigor. . . 
 Utmost rigor might not be enough. If anyone makes it to this, please send a report!
