AstraZeneca Closes a Lab - In India This Time
29 Jan 2014

Now here's a story (http://www.firstwordpharma.com/node/1183323?tsid=28&region_id=6) that you might not have expected to see a few years ago: AstraZeneca is closing a research site in Bangalore, with some of its functions (tropical disease work) to move back to the UK. I'm not sure what this says about Bangalore, tropical diseases, or AstraZeneca (who have plenty on their agenda), but it does have a dog-bites-man man-bites-dog feel to it, rightly or not. Edit: I apparently am confused about who is normally gnawing on whom.
