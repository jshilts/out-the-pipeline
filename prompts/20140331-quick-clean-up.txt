A Quick Clean-Up
31 Mar 2014

Well, while I wasn't watching over the weekend, the comments section to this post (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/03/28/more_on_the_utaustin_retraction_case) kind of veered off the road. I've deleted a number of trolling comments, and all the various replies to them, and further comments to that entry are now closed. I rarely do this sort of thing, but (ironically) I was just saying the other evening that pretty much the only time I delete comments is when they're nothing but ad hominem . There are plenty of other places on the web to trade insults and gibberish (some sites specialize in nothing but), so I don't think it's any great loss to the world if this site doesn't join in. We'll now resume our regularly scheduled programming.
