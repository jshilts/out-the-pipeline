Off To the Publishers
1 Apr 2014

I don't know if my publisher was pulling my leg by having the deadline for the manuscript of "The Chemistry Book" (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/11/21/the_chemistry_book) be April 1, but that's what the contract says. And I've sent the thing off, so it's now in the hands of the editors. There's more to be done - I have some more dates to track down, for one, and I'd like to insert some more references for further reading. And then there are the illustrations, for which I've sent along many suggestions, and I'll need to write the captions for those once we've settled on what pictures to use. But the bulk writing is done, I'm glad to say.
