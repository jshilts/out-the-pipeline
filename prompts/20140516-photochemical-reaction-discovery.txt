They have a 1000-watt high-pressure mercury lamp going, with appropriate filters (with that sort of light flux, you have a lot of spectral windows (http://books.google.com/books?id=ivZow2hTOGkC&pg=PA28&dq=spectral+irradiance+of+450W+xenon&hl=en&sa=X&ei=nEB2U9HBLI23yATchYGQBA&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=spectral%20irradiance%20of%20450W%20xenon&f=false) to choose from). 
 They're using this setup in both batch and flow mode to do reaction discovery (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/04/05/more_reaction_discovery) - picking out starting materials with appropriate chromphores and seeing that what they get when they irradiate them under different conditions (solvent, sensitizers, residence time and so on). From my own photochemical experiences, I can assume that the results will provide plenty of material to work on - these sorts of reactions can take drastically different courses all of a sudden. The time-intensive step is not doubt the part where you figure out what the heck happened. 
 The scheme shown is representative - the top product is a photo-Fries rearrangement, while the bottom one is clearly a 2+2 and some sort of sulfonyl migration. There are vast unexplored swaths of territory (both in reaction space and chemical space) to be found in photochemistry, and I look forward to seeing more weird things come out of this setup.
