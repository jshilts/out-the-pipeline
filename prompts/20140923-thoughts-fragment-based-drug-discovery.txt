Thoughts on Fragment-Based Drug Discovery
23 Sep 2014

I've been enjoying the FBLD fragment conference in Basel. There have been many good talks, and it's been instructive to talk shop with people as well. Some things that various participants (and I) have noted: 
 (1) There are a lot of industry people here, from all over. Fragment-based methods have clearly made a big impression across drug discovery - academia finds it a low-barrier way to get into compound screening, and the industrial groups clearly find it useful as well. This has already lasted longer than the combichem boom of the 1990s (a point I'll be mentioning in my talk here tomorrow), and at this point, it would appear to be not a fad at all. Fragment-derived compounds are marching along through the clinic as we speak. 
 (2) The number of instrumental and biophysical techniques to do fragment work is still growing. There are always NMR screens, SPR, and X-ray crystallography (and many variations on each of these), calorimetry and thermal shift experiments, and so on. But there are mass spec methods, chromatographic ones, thermophoresis and electrophoresis, and more where those came from. Which is good - as anyone who'd done this can tell you, you need orthogonal ways of looking at the compounds. 
 (3) Several of these technique are, though, still a bit "operator-dependent". SPR, just to pick one, needs someone experienced at the controls for the trickier experiments, because there are a lot of things that can give you funny-looking data (aggregation, compounds that bind to the chip surface, super-stoichiometric binding, and more). It's not a good part-time occupation. You can say the same thing about a lot of other screening techniques that are used for traditional high-throughput screening, though, as anyone who's troubleshooted FRET, FP, or AlphaScreen assays will tell you at length. 
 (4) There are still a lot of important and interesting things we don't quite know about fragment collections and fragment binding. Some of these are just beginning to get sorted out - what are the physical characteristics of a good fragment screening set (beyond the obvious ones of size and solubility)? Are there different sorts of collections that could give you better hit rates against targets like protein-protein interactions (there have been many examples of these at the meeting). What are the relationships between selectivity at the fragment level and selectivity in the eventual optimized compounds? The answers the questions like these are still being written. 
 I have more thoughts, naturally, but some of those my employer has first call on. I have a talk to give tomorrow (one of those 30,000-foot-overview things), right at the end of the conference, and I'll probably unburden myself of a few opinions then.
