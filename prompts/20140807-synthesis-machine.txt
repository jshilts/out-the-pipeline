The Synthesis Machine
7 Aug 2014

So I go away for a few days, and people are already planning to replace me (http://www.nature.com/news/organic-synthesis-the-robo-chemist-1.15661) (and my colleagues) with robots? Can't turn your back on anyone in this business. What that article is talking about is the long-term dream of a "synthesis machine", a device that would take whatever structure you fed into it and start in trying to make it. No such device exists - nothing even remotely close to it exists - but there's nothing impossible about it. 
 A British project called Dial-a-Molecule is laying the groundwork. Led by Whitby, the £700,000 (US$1.2-million) project began in 2010 and currently runs until May 2015. So far, it has mostly focused on working out what components the machine would need, and building a collaboration of more than 450 researchers and 60 companies to help work on the idea. The hope, says Whitby, is that this launchpad will help team members to attract the long-term support they need to achieve the vision. . . 
 . . .Some reckon it would take decades to develop an automated chemist as adept as a human — but a less capable, although still useful, device could be a lot closer. “With adequate funding, five years and we're done,” says Bartosz Grzybowski, a chemist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, who has ambitious plans for a synthesis machine of his own. 
 There's a lot of room in between "as adept as a human" and "still useful", let me tell you, and that word "useful" covers a lot of ground all by itself. But I agree that there's a lot of potential here, and that we're at least getting close to the point of being able to realize some of it. But then the arguing starts. This topic came up (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/06/13/medchem_automated) here just recently (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/06/18/more_on_automated_medicinal_chemistry) , and has before (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/03/26/automated_medchem_at_last) as well. But those examples were far more simple than the Turing-machine like ideal synthesis device. 
 That one really is decades away, I'd say. There are a lot of problems to be dealt with. For one, you have the physical handling of reagents and reaction purification. Steve Ley's group (http://www.leygroup.ch.cam.ac.uk/) and Tim Jamison's group (http://web.mit.edu/chemistry/jamison/) are two of the best at this, and I recently had a chance to hear Jamison talk about some DARPA-funded work he's been doing on an automated platform to make simple pharmaceuticals on demand. It has taken them no small amount of work (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201305429/abstract) just to get the dispensing, purification, and transfer parts to mesh correctly, and that's for compounds for which defined synthetic routes have been well worked out. Throw in the problem of figuring out a good synthetic plan (among the vast number of reaction and reagent possibilities) and the problem gets wildly, exponentially more hairy (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/07/31/synthetic_chemistry_the_rise_of_the_algorithms) . 
 That last link discusses some very interesting work from the Grzybowski group (http://dysa.northwestern.edu/) , who have been developing a system called Chematica. Here's the latest on that: 
 These demonstrations have impressed synthetic chemists, although few have had a chance to test Chematica. That is because Grzybowski is hoping to commercialize the system: he is negotiating with Elsevier to incorporate the program into Reaxys, and is working with the pharmaceutical industry to test Chematica's synthesis suggestions for biologically active, naturally occurring molecules. Grzybowski is also bidding for a grant from the Polish government, worth up to 7 million złoty (US$2.3 million), to use Chematica as the brain of a synthesis machine that can prove itself by automatically planning and executing syntheses of at least three important drug molecules. 
 I'll watch this with great interest, but it's worth noting that no one has yet tried to hook Grzybowski-type software with Jamison/Ley-type hardware. And that'll be a real joy to execute. This looks to an outsider (me) like one of those cases where the software folks figure that the hardware is pretty much ready to go, and the hardware folks might be figuring that the software is more or less at the late-debugging stage. I suspect that anyone thinking down those lines (and there are some quotes in that Nature article that suggest it) is in for a rude shock. The kinds of reactions that useful software would suggest will be things that no one has ever tried to automate, and the range of reagents that can be accommodated by the existing hardware may well cripple the software algorithms before they even get off the floor. There's a lot of work to be done. 
 My guess is that we're going to see many years of machines that can do some things in very well-defined areas, but which will prove useless (or worse) if you try to push them into unknown territory. And unknown territory is what it's all about. The article mentions the most difficult level such a machine could work at: synthetic routes where new reactions have to be invented. Don't hold your breath for that one: a machine that could work its way through the first semester of an undergraduate organic lab course would, by current standards, be a tremendous accomplishment. 
 But at the same time, I want to re-emphasize that there's nothing intrinsically impossible about any of this. It's just crazily hard, and will require years of machete-hacking through thickets of engineering difficulties. I think that this really is the direction the field is heading, but it's going to be a long, long road.
