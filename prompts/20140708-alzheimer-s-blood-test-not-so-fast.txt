An Alzheimer's Blood Test? Not So Fast.
8 Jul 2014

There all all sorts of headlines today about how there's going to be a simple blood test for Alzheimer's soon. Don't believe them. 
 This all comes from a recent publication (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1552526014024546) in the journal Alzheimer's and Dementia , from a team at King's College (London) and the company Proteome Sciences. It's a perfectly good paper, and it does what you'd think: they quantified a set of proteins in a cohort of potential Alzheimer's patients and checked to see if any of them were associated with progression of the disease. From 26 initial protein candidates (all of them previously implicated in Alzheimer's), they found that a panel of ten seemed to give a prediction that was about 87% accurate. 
 That figure was enough for a lot of major news outlets, who have run with headlines like "Blood test breakthrough" and "Blood test can predict Alzheimer's". Better ones said something more like "Closer to blood test" or "Progress towards blood test", but that's not so exciting and clickable, is it? This paper may well represent progress towards a blood test, but as its own authors, to their credit, are at pains to say, a lot more work needs to be done. 87%, for starters, is interesting, but not as good as it needs to be - that's still a lot of false negatives, and who knows how many false positives. 
 That all depends on what the rate of Alzheimer's is in the population you're screening. As Andy Extance (https://twitter.com/andyextance) pointed out on Twitter, these sorts of calculations are misunderstood by almost everyone (https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/doctors-flunk-quiz-screening-test-math) , even by people who should know better. A 90 per cent accurate test on a general population whose Alzheimer's incidence rate is 1% would, in fact, be wrong 92% of the time. Here's a more detailed writeup (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2007/10/15/checking_the_numbers_on_the_alzheimers_test) I did in 2007, spurred by reports of a similar Alzheimer's diagnostic back then. And if you have a vague feeling that you heard about all these issue (and another blood test) just a few months ago, you're right (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/03/10/a_blood_test_for_alzheimers.php) . 
 Even after that statistical problem, things are not as simple as the headlines would have you believe. This new work is a multivariate model, because a number of factors were found to affect the levels of these proteins. The age and gender of the patient were two real covariants, as you'd expect, but the duration of plasma storage before testing also had an effect, as did, apparently, the center where the collection was done. That does not sound like a test that's ready to be rolled out to every doctor's office (which is again what the authors have been saying themselves). There were also different groups of proteins that could be used for a prediction model using the set of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients, versus the ones that already appeared to show real Alzheimer's signs, which also tells you that this is not a simple turn-the-dial-on-the-disease setup. Interestingly, they also looked at whether adding brain imaging data (such as hippocampus volume) helped the prediction model. This, though, either had no real effect on the prediction accuracy, or even reduced it somewhat. 
 So the thing to do here is to run this on larger patient cohorts to get a more real-world idea of what the false negative and false positive rates are, which is the sort of obvious suggestion that is appearing in about the sixth or seventh paragraph of the popular press writeups. This is just what the authors are planning, naturally - they're not the ones who wrote the newspaper stories, after all. This same collaboration has been working on this problem for years now, I should add, and they've had ample opportunity to see their hopes not quite pan out. Here, for example (http://www.ddn-news.com/index.php?newsarticle=3150) , is a prediction of an Alzheimer's blood test entering the clinic in "12 to 18 months", from . . .well, 2009. 
 Update: here's a critique (http://www.tcpinnovations.com/drugbaron/twenty-six-of-the-best-candidate-protein -biomarkers-have-no-ability-to-predict-conversion-to-dementia-from-prodromal-disease/) of the statistical approaches used in this paper - are there more problems with it than were first apparent?
