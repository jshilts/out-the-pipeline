An Early Day Off
3 Jul 2014

Since the Fourth of July looks to be a rainy washout around here, I'm taking a day off to get a head start on the holiday weekend here. So instead of advancing the cause of science in the lab today, I'm home with a big pork shoulder, which I rubbed down with salt and dry spices last night. It's now cooking over a low charcoal fire with plenty of green hickory wood (from a small shagbark hickory tree I spotted over in the forest near the back yard). That will cook the rest of the day, and be ready for dinner. Here's a prep (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2011/05/30/memorial_day) for barbecued pork ribs from a couple of years ago. 
 Dessert will be the lime sorbet I mentioned here (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/09/02/a_quick_recipe_lime_sorbet) last year. If you're at all into lemon or lime as a flavor, give that one a try - it's easy, and the results from fresh lime juice are spectacular. Two large-scale, tested preparations, then, for today - I just have to keep an eye on things to make sure that everything is going according to plan.
