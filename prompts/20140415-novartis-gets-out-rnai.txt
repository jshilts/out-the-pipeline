Novartis Gets Out of RNAi
15 Apr 2014

Yesterday brought the sudden news that Novartis is pulling their RNA interference research work. The company is citing difficulties in development, and also the strategic point that not as many disease areas seem to be open to the use of the technique as they'd like. John LaMattina has more here (http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnlamattina/2014/04/15/big-pharmas-turn-on-rnai-shows-that-new-technologies-dont-guarantee-rd-success/) - it's looking more and more like this may be a good field for smaller companies like Alnylam (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/01/13/alnylam_makes_it_as_does_rnai) , but not something that's going to feed the beast at a company the size of Novartis (or Merck, who exited a while ago (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2011/08/02/merck_rnai_alnylam_and_so_on) ). If there's some sort of technology breakthrough, that could change - but you get the impression that Novartis was hoping for one before now.
