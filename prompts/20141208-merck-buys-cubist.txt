Merck Buys Cubist
8 Dec 2014

So Merck is buying Cubist (http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-12-08/merck-to-buy-cubist-for-8-dot-4-billion-to-add-antibiotics) , the specialty antibiotic company. There's been a lot of talk in the press over the years about how big drug companies have bailed out of antibiotic research because no money could be made in it, and this deal will probably set off more stories about how all that's changing, but that's really not the main part of the story. Cubist has been doing fine, with revenues of over $800 million, mostly from Cubicin (daptomycin) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daptomycin) , a ferocious-looking natural product that has one of the very new antibiotic mechanisms of recent years. 
 Here (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/07/25/the_antibiotic_gap_its_all_of_the_above) are a couple (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/05/15/the_daily_show_on_finding_new_antibiotics) of posts on the problems of antibiotic drug discovery. It's no stroll through the garden, I can tell you from personal experience, and it's gotten harder and harder over the years. If you find something, you can do well with it, as Cubist has shown, but first find something that hasn't been found before, and we'll talk. That hasn't changed; nothing about antibiotic drug discovery has changed. It's just that Cubist has had some success, and Merck would like to appropriate that for its own pipeline.
