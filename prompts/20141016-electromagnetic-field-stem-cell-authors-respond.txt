The Electromagnetic Field Stem Cell Authors Respond
16 Oct 2014

The authors of the ACS Nanopaper (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/nn502923s) ACS Nano on using electromagnetic fields to produce stem cells have responded on PubPeer (https://pubpeer.com/publications/A730F960943331E553B54335FE8877#fb15628) . They have a good deal to say on the issues around the images in their paper (see the link), and I don't think that argument is over yet. But here's what they have on criticisms of their paper in general: 
 Nowhere in our manuscript do we claim “iPSCs can be made using magnetic fields”. This would be highly suspect indeed. Rather, we demonstrate that in the context of highly reproducible and well-established reprogramming to pluripotency with the Yamanaka factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and cMyc/or Oct4 alone), EMF influences the efficiency of this process. Such a result is, to us, not surprising given that EMF has long been noted to have effects on biological system(Adey 1993, Del Vecchio et al. 2009, Juutilainen 2005)(There are a thousand of papers for biological effects of EMF on Pubmed) and given that numerous other environmental parameters are well-known to influence reprogramming by the Yamanaka factors, including Oxygen tension (Yoshida et al. 2009), the presence of Vitamin C (Esteban et al. 2010), among countless other examples. 
 For individuals such as Brookes and Lowe to immediately discount the validity of the findings without actually attempting to reproduce the central experimental finding is not only non-scientific, but borders on slanderous. We suggest that these individuals take their skepticism to the laboratory bench so that something productive can result from the time they invest prior to their criticizing the work of others. 
 That "borders on slanderous" part does not do the authors any favors, because it's a rather silly position to take. When you publish a paper, you have opened the floor to critical responses. I'm a medicinal chemist - no one is going to want to let me into their stem cell lab, and I don't blame them. But I'm also familiar with the scientific literature enough to wonder (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/10/14/electromagnetic_production_of_stem_cells_really) what a paper on this subject is doing in ACS Nano and whether its results are valid. I note that the paper itself states that ". . .this physical energy can affect cell fate changes and is essential for reprogramming to pluripotency." 
 If it makes the authors feel better, I'll rephrase: their paper claims that iPSCs can be made more efficiently by adding electromagnetic fields to the standard transforming-factor mixture. (And they also claim that canceling out the Earth's magnetic field greatly slows this process down). These are very interesting and surprising results, and my first impulse is to wonder if they're valid. That's my first impulse every time I read something interesting and surprising, by the way, so the authors shouldn't take this personally. 
 There are indeed many papers in PubMed on the effects of electromagnetic fields on cellular processes. But this area has also been very controversial, and (as an outside observer) my strong impression is that there have been many problems with irreproducibility. I have no doubt that people with expertise in stem cell biology will be taking a look at this report and trying to reproduce it as well, and I am eager to see what happens next.
