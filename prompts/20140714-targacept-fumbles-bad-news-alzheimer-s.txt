Targacept Fumbles the Bad News on Alzheimer's
14 Jul 2014

Targacept has been working on some very hard therapeutic areas over the years, and coming up dry - dramatically so (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/10/08/targacept_cuts_way_back) . They may have just done it again. 
 They've been testing TC-1734 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ispronicline) in Alzheimer's over the last year or so, a partial agonist at nicotinergic receptors. That was a long-shot mechanism to start with, although to be sure, every Alzheimer's drug is a long-shot mechanism. This would be a stopgap compound even if it worked, like the existing acetylcholinesterase compound Donepezil (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donepezil) . 
 And the company has apparently released the results of the clinical trial on its web site, inadvertently, you'd have to assume. The news first came out from BioRunUp (https://twitter.com/BioRunUp) on Twitter, and the text of the announcement was the the compound had failed to show superiority to Donepezil. The company has made no official announcement (as I write, anyway), and the press release itself appears to have been taken down a little while ago. But here's a screen shot (https://twitter.com/adamfeuerstein/status/488753589754814464/photo/1) , if you're interested. The stock (TRGT) has already reacted to the news, as you'd imagine it would, suddenly dropping (https://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&chdd=1&chds=1&chdv=1&chvs=maximized&chdeh=0&chfdeh=0&chdet=1405368000000&chddm=391&chls=IntervalBasedLine&q=NASDAQ:TRGT&ntsp=0&ei=qSfEU9jTIIen8gaEmYGABg) like a brick starting at just before 2:30 PM EST. Not a good way to get the news out, that's for sure. . .
