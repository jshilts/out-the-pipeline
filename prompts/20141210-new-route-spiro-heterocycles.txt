It's from Jeffrey Bode's group at the ETH in Zürich (authors of a recent review (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/03/24/nitrogen_heterocycles_ahoy) in this area), and it's another version of their "SnAP" chemistry, tin-mediated conditions for ring formation. Bode and coauthor Woon-Yew Siau report a variety of interesting compounds, some of which would be rather painful to make by other routes. 
 No one's crazy about using tin, but the transformation is too useful to pass up. It seems to work well with a variety of cyclic ketones, for one thing, and can be extended to acyclic trifluormethyl ketones as well. On the heterocycle side, there are a few limitations. Trying it on N-proteced 3-keto pyrrolidines or piperidines, for example, gives low yields (too much diversion into an enamine). I would guess that overcoming this problem is a current research focus in the group. Larger rings than the 7-membered one also don't form well - not to anyone's surprise, since those are a pain under most conditions. 
 But given the number of useful morpholines, piperazines, and piperidines out there, I'm very glad to have another route to crank them out, particularly with the less-studied quaternary carbons. There's probably some tin in my future, darn it all. About the author Derek Lowe (https://www.science.org/content/author/derek-lowe) View more (#) Comments IN THE PIPELINE
