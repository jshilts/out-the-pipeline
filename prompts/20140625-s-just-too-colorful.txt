It's not in a structural class that normally I would be exploring, but it's been a while since I was on a normal project, so that's fine. But this thing - yikes. I keep telling myself "It's a probe, it's a tool, don't worry", as all my med-chem instincts tell me that a compound like this, whose color would blend in only with a pile of nasturtiums (https://namethatplant.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/watermark_1000.jpg) , cannot be clean. But it is. And those same instincts keep telling me that a compound this wildly colorful can never, ever be of any use in a biological setting. It's an irrational prejudice, but it dies hard.
