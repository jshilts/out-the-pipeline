Exelixis Against the Wall
2 Sep 2014

Exelixis is a company with a very interesting history (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2010/06/23/exelixis_gets_a_compound_back) , but that's in the sense of "much rather read about it than experience it", like the interesting parts in a history book. At one point they had a really outsized pipeline of kinase inhibitors, to the point where it could be hard to keep track of everything, but these projects have largely blown up over the last few years. Big collaboration deals have been wound down, compounds have been returned to them, and so on. 
 Most recently, the company has been developing cabozantinib (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabozantinib) for prostate cancer. Along the way (2011) they had a dispute with the FDA about clinical trial design - the company had a much speedier surrogate endpoint in mind, but the agency wasn't having it. At this point, there are enough options in that area to make overall survival the real endpoint that matters, and the FDA told them to go out and get that data instead of messing around with surrogates. So the company plowed ahead, and yesterday announced Phase III results. They weren't good. The compound showed some effects in progression-free survival (PFS), but seems to have no benefit in the longer-running overall survival (OS) measurement. And that one's the key. 
 There's no way to put a good spin on it, either. The same press release that announced the results also announced that the company was going to have to "initiate a significant workforce reduction" in order to make it through the two other ongoing cabozantinib trials (for renal cell carcinoma and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma). Exelixis has had some pretty brutal workforce reductions over the years already, so this would appear to be cutting down as far as things can be cut ( from 330 employees down to 70 (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/cabozantinib-flops-against-prostate-cancer-forcing-big-jobs-cuts-exelixis/2014-09-01) ). And those two remaining indications are tough ones, too - if the compound shows efficacy, it'll be very good news, but those are not the first battlefields you'd choose to fight on. The prostate results don't offer much room for optimism, but on the other hand, the compound has orphan drug status for medullary thyroid cancer, for which it has shown real benefit (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24002501) in a disease that otherwise has no real treatment at all. 
 So Exelixis will try to stay alive long enough to get through these last trials, and if nothing comes up there, I'd have to think that this will be it for them. You wouldn't have predicted this back in about 2002, but you can't predict anything important in this industry to start with.
