A New Book
3 Feb 2014

Noted as a significant new book relevant to biopharma, but necessarily without any comment from me is Barry Werth's The Antidote: Inside the World of New Pharma (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451655665/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1451655665&linkCode=as2&tag=lagniappe-20) , which is the sequel to his 1995 book, The Billion Dollar Molecule (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671510576/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0671510576&linkCode=as2&tag=lagniappe-20) .
