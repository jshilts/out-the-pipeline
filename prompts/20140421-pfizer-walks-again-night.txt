Pfizer Walks Again By Night
21 Apr 2014

So the Sunday Times came out with a story (http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/business/Companies/article1401626.ece) saying that Pfizer has attempted a bid for AstraZeneca. This is something of a surprise, at least for me. Pfizer has most certainly done things like this in the past, but I was under the impression that current CEO Ian Read had sworn off (http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2011/05/01/pfizers-radical-surgery/) the practice. He's been talking for some time now about how the company needs to be the right size, to focus on drug discovery, and so on, and swallowing AZ just seems to be a return to old habits. 
 But the Bloomberg follow-up story on this scoop does mention (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-20/pfizer-made-101-billion-bid-for-astrazeneca-times-says.html) how Read's answers to merger questions seems to have shifted a bit over the last year or two. The Sunday Times piece says that AZ is believed to have been unenthusiastic, and that talks are no longer continuing. But the whole thing makes a person think that Pfizer is hungry for a big deal again, and that means that no one is safe. 
 Update: more follow-up (http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/20/pfizer-astrazeneca-takeover-rumours-jobs) from the Guardian.
