Fazlul Sarkar Subpoenas PubPeer
27 Oct 2014

Last month I mentioned (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/09/24/see_you_in_court_not_likely) that a professor at Wayne State, Fazlul Sarkar, was thinking of suing the PubPeer (https://pubpeer.com/) site or its commenters, after a host of negative comments on his papers disrupted his move to the University of Mississippi. Well, he's making good (http://retractionwatch.com/2014/10/26/scientist-sues-pubpeer-commenters-subpoenas-site-for-names/) on that threat, according to Retraction Watch . 
 The court papers have all the details on just what a deal he was getting at Ole Miss: 

First, we learn that in addition to a salary of $350,000, which has been previously reported, the University of Mississippi had offered Sarkar “Commitment to ‘help us realize the $2 million level on endowed professorship,’ “Relocation expenses up to $15,000,” “Laboratory and office space in two locations, Research Assistant Professors, up to two additional Research Associates, and administrative support,” “A start up package of $750,000,” and “Moving expenses for the laboratory and senior personnel.” 
 Sarkar had already signed the papers and submitted his resignation back in Detroit (and put his house on the market) when everything hit the skids. According to the court documents: 

[I]n a letter dated June 19, 2014 – just eleven days before Dr. Sarkar was to begin his active employment – Dr. [Larry Walker, the Director of the National Center for Natural Products Research at the University of Mississippi Cancer Institute] rescinded that employment, as additionally confirmed by the Chancellor Jones on June 27, in effect terminating Dr. Sarkar before he’d even begun. Dr. Walker’s June 19, 2014 letter cited PubPeer as the reason, stating in relevant part that he had “received a series of emails forwarded anonymously from (sic?)PubPeer.com, containing several posts regarding papers from your lab. . . 
 Now the question is, who is Professor Sarkar suing, and what does he hope to accomplish? PubPeer itself is surely protected by the provisions of the Communications Decency Act that shield web site owners from comments made by users - this has been tested several times, to the best of my knowledge, and has held up every time. And Sarkar isn't suing PubPeer itself, apparently. The professor seems to mostly want the site's administrators to divulge the identities of the commenters who left so many damaging details (and who, presumably, had a lot to do with sending all those details to a list of people at Mississippi, just in case they'd missed them). 

I'm not sure how far that's going to get - I mean, what could the PubPeer folks have? IP addresses? Which probably resolve to a block of Comcast or Verizon stuff that can't be narrowed down much further? The NSA might know who these people are, but I'll bet PubPeer doesn't. And what, exactly, is Professor Sarkar going to do even if his lawyers manage to track someone down? Let's be real - a university does not suddenly throw the brakes on a big tenured hire just because of a bunch of misty allegations and unsourced grumbing. No, one of the comments at Retraction Watch provides an example (at left) of the sort of thing that appears to be at the root of the problem, from this paper (http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/65/19/9064.short) , which Google Scholar says has 183 citations. (A larger version can be found here (http://i.imgur.com/gO58vGV.png) , where you can see all the little artifacts of the gel lanes, and what appear to be the same artifacts as they rotate, flip, and duplicate across the figures). And this one hadn't even been posted to PubPeer yet, so my impression is that there's a lot of this stuff. 
 If this is the sort of thing that was mailed to everyone at Ole Miss, I can see how it might have caused some rethinking. (The university probably didn't have a Distinguished Chair of Photoshop position open). At the very least, someone in Prof. Sarkar's lab appears to have been putting together a portfolio for such a job. Can someone be defamed by having the figures from his own papers reproduced? 
 At any rate, I'm glad to help draw attention to his plight, and to bring details of it to people who might otherwise have missed out. Lawsuits tend to have that effect, especially lawsuits against internet sites. I will watch the progress through the legal system of Prof. Sarkar's case with great interest. Commenters to the previous post here noted that (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/09/24/see_you_in_court_not_likely#1557506) this will not be an easy one (nor a cheap one) to pursue. A comment (http://retractionwatch.com/2014/10/26/scientist-sues-pubpeer-commenters-subpoenas-site-for-names/#comment-164099) at Retraction Watch mentions that Sarkar is on the editorial board of a host of journals, many of which are on the Beall list of predatory publishers. Perhaps he has that to fall back on? 
 Update: got Prof. Fazlul's name correct, and consistently spelled. Better copy-and-paste skills would have come in handy there, I have to admit.
