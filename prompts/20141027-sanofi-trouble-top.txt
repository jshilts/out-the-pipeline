The reasons are various, ranging from his move to Boston, through the state of the company's oncology portfolio, all the way to his outspokenness, which is not very French. (That last quality has been noted (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/06/06/sanofis_feeling_just_wonderful) here as well (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/03/01/what_sanofi_thinks_about_you) , several times (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2010/01/20/honesty_of_a_sort) . All of this may just be rumor-mongering, or it could be someone else's boardroom politics. But you can bet that people inside Sanofi are watching and wondering. 
 Update: definitely not just rumors. Via John Carroll at FierceBiotech, here's a letter (http://www.slideshare.net/jm_cedro/sanofi-lettre-confidentielle-de-chris-viehbacher) that Viehbacher sent to Sanofi's board in September, outlining reasons why they shouldn't replace him. Note that the only reason we're seeing this is presumably it's been leaked by someone who wants him replaced. . .
