Electromagnetic Production of Stem Cells? Really?
14 Oct 2014

Now this is an odd paper (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/nn502923s) : its subject matter is unusual, where it's published is unusual, and it's also unusual that no one seems to have noticed it. I hadn't, either. A reader sent it along to me: "Electromagnetic Fields Mediate Efficient Cell Reprogramming into a Pluripotent State". 
 Yep, this paper says that stem cells can be produced from ordinary somatic cells by exposure to electromagnetic fields. Everyone will recall the furor that attended the reports that cells could be reprogrammed by exposure to weak acid baths (and the eventual tragic collapse of the whole business). So why isn't there more noise around this publication? 
 One answer might be that not many people who care about stem cell biology read ACS Nano , and there's probably something to that. But that immediately makes you wonder why the paper is appearing there to start with, because it's also hard to see how it relates to nanotechnology per se . An uncharitable guess would be that the manuscript made the rounds of several higher profile and/or more appropriate journals, and finally ended up where it is (I have no evidence for this, naturally, but I wouldn't be surprised to hear that this was the case). 
 So what does the paper itself have to say? It claims that "extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields" can cause somatic cells to transform into pluripotent cells, and that this process is mediated by EMF effects on a particular enzyme, the histone methyltransferase MII2. That's an H3K4 methyltransferase, and it has been found to be potentially important (http://www.nature.com/srep/2014/140704/srep05580/full/srep05580.html) in germline stem cells and spermatogenesis (http://www.epigeneticsandchromatin.com/content/2/1/5) . Otherwise, I haven't seen anyone suggesting it as a master regulator of stem cell generation, but then, there's a lot that we don't know about epigenetics and stem cells. 
 There is, however, a lot that we do know about electromagnetism. Over the years, there have been uncountable reports of biological activity for electromagnetic fields. You can go back to the controversy over the effects of power lines in residential areas and the later disputes about the effects of cell phones, just to pick two that have had vast amounts of coverage. The problem is, no one seems to have been able to demonstrate anything definite in any of these cases. As far as I know, studies have either shown no real effects, or (when something has turned up), no one's been able to reproduce it. That goes both for laboratory studies and for attempts at observational or epidemiological studies, too: nothing definite, over and over. 
 There's probably a reason for that. I have trouble with is the mechanism by which an enzyme gets induced by low-frequency electromagnetic fields, and that's always been the basic argument against such things. You almost have to assume new physics to make a strong connection, because nothing seems to fit: the energies involved are too weak, the absorptions don't match up, and so on. Or at least that's what I thought, but this paper has a whole string of references about how extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields do all sorts of things to all sorts of cell types. But it's worth noting that the authors also reference papers showing that they're linked to cancer epidemiology, too. It's true, though, that if you do a Pubmed search for "low frequency electromagnetic field" you get a vast pile of references, although I'm really not sure about some of them. 
 The authors say that the maximum effect in their study was seen at 50 Hz, 1 mT. That is indeed really, really low frequency (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_low_frequency) - the wavelength for a radio signal down there is about 6000 kilometers. Just getting antennas to work in that range is a major challenge, and it's hard for me to picture how subcellular structures could respond to these wavelengths at all. There seem to be all sorts of theories in the literature about how enzyme-level and transcription-level effects might be achieved, but no consensus (from what I can see). Most of the mechanistic discussions I've seen avoid the question entirely - they talk about what enzyme system or signaling pathway might be the "mechanism" for the reported effects, but skip over the big question of how these effects might arise in the first place . 
 An even odder effect reported in this paper is that the authors also tried these in an experimental setup (a Helmholz coil) that canceled out the usual environment of the Earth's magnetic field. They found that this worked much less efficiently, and suggest that the natural magnetic field must have epigenetic effects. I don't know what to make of that one, either. Normal cells grown under these conditions showed no effects, so the paper hypothesizes that some part of the pluripotency reprogramming process is exceptionally sensitive. Here, I'll let the authors summarize: 
 As one of the fundamental forces of nature, the EMF is a physical energy produced by electrically charged objects that can affect the movement of other charged objects in the field. Here we show that this physical energy can affect cell fate changes and is essential for reprogramming to pluripotency. Exposure of cell cultures to EMFs significantly improves reprogramming efficiency in somatic cells. Interestingly, EL-EMF exposure combined with only one Yamanaka factor, Oct4, can generate iPSCs, demonstrating that EL-EMF expo- sure can replace Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc during reprogramming. These results open a new possibility for a novel method for efficient generation of iPSCs. Although many chemical factors or additional genes have been reported for the generation of iPSCs, limitations such as integration of foreign genetic elements or efficiency remain a challenge. Thus, EMF-induced cell fate changes may eventually provide a solution for efficient, noninvasive cell reprogramming strategies in regenerative medicine. 
 Interestingly, our results show that ES cells and fibroblasts themselves are not significantly affected by EMF exposure; rather, cells undergoing dramatic epigenetic changes such as reprogramming seem to be uniquely susceptible to the effects of EMFs. . . 
 I don't know what to make of this paper, or the whole field of research. Does anyone? 
 Update: PubPeer is now reporting (https://pubpeer.com/publications/A730F960943331E553B54335FE8877) some problems with images in the paper. Stay, uh, tuned. . .
