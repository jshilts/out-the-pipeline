The Stock Buybacks Roll On
23 Sep 2014

We've had a couple (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/02/08/buying_back_shares_an_admission_of_defeat/) of vigorous discussions (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/08/23/more_on_pharma_stock_buybacks) about share buyback programs around here, but for those who'd like some more, let me recommend this comment thread (http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2014/09/are-stock-buybacks-too-high.html#comments) over at Marginal Revolution. The starting point was this article (http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/f098df90-3fef-11e4-936b-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=intl#axzz3Dye8zT4z) in the Financial Times . 
 One of the interesting points made is that management may well prefer buybacks to dividends because they tend to hold options. The tax treatment of the two has become more similar since 2003, but buybacks have increased, so taxes alone don't seem to be the key factor. But if you pay a dividend, it's out the door, whereas if you prop up the stock price, your future option transactions are disproportionately affected. (Balancing that, the stock price should, in theory, reflect expected future dividends, but this is one of the points that's argued in the comments thread). 
 And as mentioned here before, I think that another big factor in approving buyback programs is that no one has ever been fired for doing it . Whereas spending that money on something turned out not to work - people have lost their CEO positions for that sort of thing, so who needs it?
