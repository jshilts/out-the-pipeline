Scam, Scam, Scam, Scam, Scammity Scam, Wonderful Scam

You know, it's really hard to explain just how ridiculous the bottom end of the scientific publishing world is. I've mentioned formerly reputable journals that now want you (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/08/25/citable_garbage) to wire money to a bank account in the Turks and Caicos Islands and long lists of people who will "review" and "publish" outright gibberish (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/04/22/j_appl_drivel_or_gibberish_lett_choices_choices) as long as the checks clear (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/11/19/more_on_the_open_access_sting_article) . Note that the money is the only real thing in that transaction, but note also that some reputable publishers have fallen for random nonsense (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/03/06/we_are_pleased_to_publish_your_senseless_ravings) under the traditional publishing model as well. And there are people who will add your name to a paper for a fee (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/12/02/authorship_for_sale_papers_for_sale_everything_for_sale) , or even whip up some reasonable-looking data and write the whole thing up, for a somewhat larger fee. Don't have a journal to send it to? They'll fake one up for you (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/09/30/theyll_fake_the_journal_if_youll_fake_the_papers) . It's just an endless garbage heap. 
 Some recent posts over at ScholarlyOA make this amusingly clear. Here's a letter (PDF) (https://scholarlyoa.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/copy-of-the-email.pdf) from one of these so-called publishers inviting submissions to the "American Based Researche Journal" (very much sic ), and you know you're in for a good time when it starts off "Dear Dear Author". It's signed by "Dr. Merry Jeans, New York, USA", but the content and grammar of the letter makes it appear that Dr. Merry has been the victim of a recent severe concussion. Or several. 
 And how about the "Integrated Journal of British" (http://scholarlyoa.com/2014/10/09/ridiculous-oa-journal-launches-with-ridiculous-title/) ? Integrated Journal of British what , you say, but that's because you're narrow-minded. This, folks, is the journal of British, full stop. As ScholarlyOA discovered, their spiffy logo appears to have been lifted from a home-improvement contractor in Wisconsin, and I am not making this up. This fine publication makes a big deal out of their impact factor, 3.3275 (note the significant figures on that one). How, you wonder, does a journal like this have an impact factor like that from Thomson-Reuters-ISI? Narrow-mindedness again, friend: they have something even better, an impressive-looking certificate from the helpful people at "Universal Impact Factor (http://uifactor.org/) ". 
 Who they? Good question. They appear to be a fake-impact-factor shop, there to slap numbers on laughable fake journals, doubtless for a fee. (My wife is fond of quoting an Iranian proverb that translates as "A thief robs a thief, and God smiles"). I may be wronging them in that assumption, though. Their page for submitting a new journal to the database makes no mention of any fees per se , and after all, it does say that, and I quote, "Journals those who submitted fake or faulty data, will not consider for Evaluation". 
 If you put any journal you've ever heard of into the UIFactor database, you will find nothing. They're not interested in rating journals you've heard of; it's not their market. But if you look through their coverage list (http://www.uifactor.org/JournalMasterList.aspx?Year=2013) , you will find treasure after treasure. There's the "World Journal of Pharmaceutical Research", whose home country is listed as "Bulagria", which might as well be correct. "Corea" makes an appearance, and there are three entries for the "European Journal of Experimental Biology", all with different impact factors, but all listed as coming from Iraq. And so on - there's all sorts of exotica on the list, but what they all have in common is that if you click on any of the journal names, the detailed information page for each of them is infested with HTML spam for "online abortion pills" where the journal URL should be. Every single time. Someone is clearly paying close attention here. 
 So that leaves us with a journal-rating website, itself apparently a scam, which rates piles of obscure journals, many of them scams of their own. And it in turn has been infected by still more scamsters. It's a long way down, that's for sure, and the bottom is nowhere to be seen.
