A New Look At Clinical Attrition
10 Jan 2014

Thanks to this new article (http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v32/n1/full/nbt.2786.html) in Nature Biotechnology , we have recent data on the failure rates in drug discovery. Unfortunately, this means that we have recent data on the failure rates in drug discovery, and the news is not good. 
 The study is the largest and most recent of its kind, examining success rates of 835 drug developers, including biotech companies as well as specialty and large pharmaceutical firms from 2003 to 2011. Success rates for over 7,300 independent drug development paths are analyzed by clinical phase, molecule type, disease area and lead versus nonlead indication status. . .Unlike many previous studies that reported clinical development success rates for large pharmaceutical companies, this study provides a benchmark for the broader drug development industry by including small public and private biotech companies and specialty pharmaceutical firms. The aim is to incorporate data from a wider range of clinical development organizations, as well as drug modalities and targets. . . 
 To illustrate the importance of using all indications to determine success rates, consider this scenario. An antibody is developed in four cancer indications, and all four indications transition successfully from phase 1 to phase 3, but three fail in phase 3 and only one succeeds in gaining FDA approval. Many prior studies reported this as 100% success, whereas our study differentiates the results as 25% success for all indications, and 100% success for the lead indication. Considering the cost and time spent on the three failed phase 3 indications, we believe including all 'development paths' more accurately reflects success and R&D productivity in drug development. 
 So what do they find? 10% of all indications in Phase I eventually make it through the FDA, which is in line with what most people think. Failure rates are in the thirty-percent range in Phase I, in the 60-percent range in Phase II, thirty to forty percent in Phase III, and in the teens at the NDA-to-approval stage. Broken out by drug class (antibody, peptide, small molecule, vaccine, etc.), the class with the most brutal attrition is (you guessed it) small molecules: slightly over 92% of them entering Phase I did not make it to approval. 
 If you look at things by therapeutic area, oncology has the roughest row to hoe with over 93% failure. Its failure rate is still over 50% in Phase III, which is particularly hair-raising. Infectious disease, at the other end of the scale, is merely a bit over 83%. Phase II is where the different diseases really separate out by chance of success, which makes sense. 
 Overall, this is a somewhat gloomier picture than we had before (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2004/09/20/drug_development_the_current_odds) , and the authors have reasonable explanations for it: 
 Factors contributing to lower success rates found in this study include the large number of small biotech companies represented in the data, more recent time frame (2003–2011) and higher regulatory hurdles for new drugs. Small biotech companies tend to develop riskier, less validated drug classes and targets, and are more likely to have less experienced development teams and fewer resources than large pharmaceutical corporations. The past nine-year period has been a time of increased clinical trial cost and complexity for all drug development sponsors, and this likely contributes to the lower success rates than previous periods. In addition, an increasing number of diseases have higher scientific and regulatory hurdles as the standard of care has improved over the past decade. 
 So there we have it - if anyone wants numbers, these are the numbers. The questions are still out there for all of us, though: how sustainable is a business with these kinds of failure rates? How feasible are the pricing strategies that can accommodate them? And what will break out out of this system, anyway?
