One and Done
16 Apr 2014

Matthew Herper has a good piece (http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2014/04/16/a-lucky-drug-made-pharmacyclics-robert-duggan-a-billionaire-will-long-term-success-follow/) in Forbes on Robert Duggan and Pharmacyclics. In the course of it, we learn this interesting (and perhaps disturbing) bit of information: 
 Second acts in the biotech business are hard: 56% of the drug firms that received an FDA approval between 1950 and 2011 did so only once. 
 And I hate to say it, but the article does not inspire confidence in Duggan's ability to break that trend. It's surely no coincidence that the profile mentions in its first paragraph that he's a major donor to the Church of Scientology, and maybe it's just my own prejudices, but when I hear that, I'm pretty much done with thinking that a person can make rational decisions.
