Get your heavy-metal chicken wings, because there's no substitute for that tangy mercury sauce. The people at Buffalo Wild Wings obviously know nothing whatsoever about the periodic table, but they're providing amusement for those of us who do. This one goes near the top of the pile of Stupid Chemistry Ads, for sure. (From Reddit's r/chemistry (http://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/) ). 
 Update: as pointed out in the comments, the company's web site (http://buffalowildwings.com/en/saucelab/#honey-ginger-kick) now has a disclaimer that you just don't see as much these days: "Product does not contain Mercury". Five minutes of reading beforehand and you wouldn't have to tell people that, guys.
