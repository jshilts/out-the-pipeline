A Timeline from Cell
10 Feb 2014

Here's a very interesting feature (http://www.cell.com/cell-timeline-40#.UvjkqXddWNJ) from Cell - an interactive timeline on the journal's 40th anniversary, highlighting some of the key papers it's published over the years. This installment takes us up into the early 1980s. When you see the 1979 paper that brings the news that tyrosine groups on proteins actually get phosphorylated post-translation, the 1982 discovery of Ras as involved in human cancer cells, or another 1982 paper showing that telomeres have these weird repeating units on them, you realize how young the sciences molecular and cell biology really are.
