AbbVie and Shire, Quietly
8 Jul 2014

Pfizer's bid for AstraZeneca made headlines for weeks on both sides of the Atlantic. But there's another US drug company trying to buy a British one right now - AbbVie for Shire - and it's going on very quietly indeed. 
 Over at FierceBiotech, they're wondering (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/wheres-uk-outrage-over-abbvies-pursuit-shire/2014-07-07?utm_medium=nl&utm_source=internal) why that should be so, after an article (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/pharmaceuticalsandchemicals/10947866/AbbVie-battle-for-Shire-why-this-time-its-different.html) in the Telegraph . There are several reasons, some better than others. For one thing, the whole deal is a smaller affair than the Pfizer saga. Most importantly, it would involve fewer UK jobs, because Shire itself doesn't really have all that many employees in the UK (91% of them are elsewhere!) Some years ago, they reworked themselves into an Irish-domiciled company, anyway, for (you guessed it) tax purposes. But there's not much noise in Ireland about this deal, either. 
 Fewer politicians have an interest in what's going on. If names change on pieces of paper, and it hardly affects anyone in their constituencies, then they have other things to worry about. The financial reasons behind the deal are similar to Pfizer's - relatively generous corporate tax policies, but the principles behind those, and behind deals predicated on them, was never the primary political concern. You might have gotten a different impression from some of the speechmaking that went on during the Pfizer/AZ business, but that's what comes from listening to politicians, rather than watching their actions with the sound off. I recommend that technique; it improves the signal/noise immensely.
