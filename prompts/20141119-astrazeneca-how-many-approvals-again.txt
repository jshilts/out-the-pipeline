AstraZeneca: How Many Approvals, Again?
19 Nov 2014

So AstraZeneca says that they're expecting (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/astrazeneca-toasts-independent-living-big-plans-its-pfizer-free-future/2014-11-18) "8 to 10 " approvals in 2015-2016. Has anyone ever done that? Even close? I take it that this whole press release is there to pump up investors and keep Pfizer from coming back and making another bid for them, but although the company does have a lot of stuff going on, this just seems wildly optimistic. What's the modern record for most drug approvals in one year? Two years?
