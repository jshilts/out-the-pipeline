This will probably not come as good news to those people (and I'm one of them) who think that too much crap makes it through the system as is, but it appears that the PTO is granting more applications than ever. 
 Vox lays the blame on the policies of David Kappos, appointed by President Obama in 2008. There certainly does seem to be an inflection point in the allowance rate. The two lines reflect the work of some researches at Virginia, who adjust for the number of re-applicant patents. That makes the real allowance rate over ninety per cent for new patents, which just has to be too high. (By the way, Vox really should rethink their tasteful color schemes; two different shades of butterscotch for a chart?) 
 Most pharma patents get granted already, I'd say. But that's because we're largely patenting new chemical matter, and it's a lot harder to argue about that. Patent quality has always been higher for new drugs than it is in many other areas, as disturbing a thought as that may be. So what else has been let through?
