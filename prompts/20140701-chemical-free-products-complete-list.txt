Chemical-Free Products: The Complete List
1 Jul 2014

Here's a comprehensive review (http://blogs.nature.com/thescepticalchymist/2014/06/a-chemical-free-paper.html) of chemical-free consumer products, courtesy of Nature Chemistry . I'm flattered to have been listed as a potential referee for this manuscript, which truly does provide the most complete list possible of chemical-free cleaners, cosmetics, and every other class of commercially available product. 
 Along similar lines, I can also recommend this site (http://howdovaccinescauseautism.com/) as an accurate, clearly stated summary of the evidence for vaccines causing autism. These are important topics that many people are interested in, and good information is essential.
