The Org Lett Spectral Hammer Falls Again
17 Feb 2014

I see that as of this moment, the five articles at the top (http://pubs.acs.org/journal/orlef7) of the Organic Letters ASAP feed are all corrections from the Nakada group. It looks to be the same situation as the Fukuyama corrections (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/02/04/put_down_that_whiteout_drop_that_photoshop_cursor) : NMR editing. The corrections (visible for free because you can see the first page) all mention that the conclusions of the papers are not altered, nor are the yields of products. So Amos Smith really is serious about his data-cleaning crusade, and I can see where he's coming from. Falsus in unum, falsus in omnibus . The only place to draw the line is right back at the start.
