Ancient Modeling
4 Apr 2014

I really got a kick out of this picture (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BkVBEyZCIAAucA5.png) that Wavefunction put up on Twitter last night. It's from a 1981 article in Fortune , and you'll just have to see the quality of the computer graphics to really appreciate it. 
 That sort of thing has hurt computer-aided drug design a vast amount over the years. It's safe to say that in 1981, Merck scientists did not (as the article asserts) "design drugs and check out their properties without leaving their consoles". It's 2014 and we can't do it like that yet. Whoever wrote that article, though, picked those ideas up from the people at Merck, with their fuzzy black-and-white monitor shots of DNA from three angles. (An old Evans and Sutherland terminal?) And who knows, some of the Merck folks may have even believed that they were close to doing it. 
 But computational power, for the most part, only helps you out when you already know how to calculate something. Then it does it for you faster. And when people are impressed (as they should be) with all that processing power can do for us now, from smart phones on up, they should still realize that these things are examples of fast, smooth, well-optimized versions of things that we know how to calculate. You could write down everything that's going on inside a smart phone with pencil and paper, and show exactly what it's working out when it display this pixel here, that pixel there, this call to that subroutine, which calculates the value for that parameter over there as the screen responds to the presence of your finger, and so on. It would be wildly tedious, but you could do it, given time. Someone, after all, had to program all that stuff, and programming steps can be written down. 
 The programs that drove those old DNA pictures could be written down, too, of course, and in a lot less space. But while the values for which pixels to light up on the CRT display were calculated exactly, the calculations behind those were (and are) a different matter. A very precise-looking picture can be drawn and animated of an animal that does not exist, and there are a lot of ways to draw animals that do not exist. The horse on your screen might look exact in every detail, except with a paisley hide and purple hooves (my daughter would gladly pay to ride one). Or it might have a platypus bill instead of a muzzle. Or look just like a horse from outside, but actually be filled with helium, because your program doesn't know how to handle horse innards. You get the idea. 
 The same for DNA, or a protein target. In 1981, figuring out exactly what happened as a transcription factor approached a section of DNA was not possible . Not to the degree that a drug designer would need. The changing conformation of the protein as it approaches the electrostatic field of the charged phosphate residues, what to do with the water molecules between the two as they come closer, the first binding event (what is it?) between the transcription factor and the double helix, leading to a cascade of tradeoffs between entropy and enthalpy as the two biomolecules adjust to each other in an intricate tandem dance down to a lower energy state. . .that stuff is hard . It's still hard. We don't know how to model some of those things well enough, and the (as yet unavoidable) errors and uncertainties in each step accumulate the further you go along. We're much better at it than we used to be, and getting better all the time, but there's a good way to go yet. 
 But while all that's true, I'm almost certainly reading too much into that old picture. The folks at Merck probably just put one of their more impressive-looking things up on the screen for the Fortune reporter, and hey, everyone's heard of DNA. I really don't think that anyone at Merck was targeting protein-DNA interactions 33 years ago (and if they were, they splintered their lance against that one, big-time). But the reporter came away with the impression that the age of computer-designed drugs was at hand, and in the years since, plenty of other people have seen progressively snazzier graphics and thought the same thing. And it's hurt the cause of modeling for them to think that, because the higher the expectations get, the harder it is to come back to reality. 
 Update: I had this originally as coming from a Forbes article; it was actually in Fortune.
