Reactive Groups: Still Not So Reactive
8 Sep 2014

Just how reactive are chemical functional groups in vivo ? That question has been approached by several groups in chemical biology, notably the Cravatt group (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2008/02/14/getting_real_with_real_cells) at Scripps. One particular paper from them that I've always come back (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2008/05/22/killing_proteins_wholesale) to is this one (http://www.nature.com/nchembio/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nchembio.91.html) , where they profiled several small electrophiles across living cells to see what they might pick up. (I blogged about more recent effort in this vein here (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/07/22/put_them_in_cells_and_find_out) as well). 
 Now there's a paper out (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm5006918) in J. Med. Chem. that takes a similar approach. The authors, from the Klein group (http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/fakultaeten/biowissenschaften/ipmb/chemie/klein/index-en.html) at Heidelberg, took six different electrophiles, attached them to a selection of nonreactive aliphatic and aromatic head groups, and profiled the resulting 72 compounds across a range of different proteins. There are some that are similar to what's been profiled in the Cravatt papers and others (alpha-chloroketones), but others I haven't seen run through this sort of experiment at all. 
 And what they found confirms the earlier work: these things, even fairly hot-looking ones, are not all that reactive against proteins. Acrylamides of all sorts were found to be quite clean, with no inhibition across the enzymes tested, and no particular reaction with GSH in a separate assay. Dimethylsulfonium salts didn't do much, either (although a couple of them were unstable to the assay conditions). Chloroacetamides showed the most reactivity against GSH, but still looked clean across the enzyme panel. 2-bromodihydroisoxazoles showed a bit of reactivity, especially against MurE (a member of the panel), but no covalent binding could be confirmed by MS (must be reversible). Cyanoacetamides showed no reactivity at all, and neither did acyl imidazoles. 
 Now, there are electrophiles that are hot enough to cause trouble. You shouldn't expect clean behavior from an acid chloride or something, but the limits are well above where most of us think they are. If some of these compounds (like the imidazolides) had been profiled across an entire proteome, then perhaps something would have turned up at a low level (as Cravatt and Weerapana saw in that link in the first paragraph). But these things will vary compound by compound - some of them will find a place where they can sit long enough for a reaction to happen, and some of them won't. Here's what the authors conclude: 
 An unexpected but significant consequence of the present study is the relatively low inhibitory potential of the reactive compounds against the analyzed enzymes. Even in cytotoxicity assays and when we looked for inhibitor enzyme adduct formation we did not find any elevated cytotoxicity or unspecific modification of proteins. Particularly in the case of chloroacetylamides/-anilides and dimethylsulfonium salts, which we consider to be among the most reactive in this series, this is a promising result. From these results the following consequences for moderately reactive groups in medicinal chemistry can be drawn. Promiscuous reactivity and off-target effects of electrophiles with moderate reactivity may often be overestimated. It also does not appear justified to generally exclude “reactive” moieties from compound libraries for screening purposes, since the nonspecific reactivity may turn out to be much inferior than anticipated. 
 There are a lot of potentially useful compounds that most of us have never thought of looking at, because of our own fears. We should go there.
