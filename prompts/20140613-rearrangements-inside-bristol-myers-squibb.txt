Rearrangements Inside Bristol-Myers Squibb
13 Jun 2014

I've heard from more than one source that BMS has been moving people around (and in some cases, out) in several departments recently. As a whole, the company has been doing quite well, but (as many have found out) that's no guarantee that you won't be re-orgged. From what I've heard, this isn't the major site-closing/therapeutic-area-dumping sort of stuff, but it does seem to be shaking up a lot of org charts.
