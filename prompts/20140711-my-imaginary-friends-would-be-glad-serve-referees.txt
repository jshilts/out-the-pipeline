My Imaginary Friends Would Be Glad to Serve as Referees
11 Jul 2014

Here's the biggest fake-peer-review operation I've heard of yet. Retraction Watch , which does not seem to be in any danger of running out of material, reports that (http://retractionwatch.com/2014/07/08/sage-publications-busts-peer-review-and-citation-ring-60-papers-retracted/) a researcher in Taiwan decided to not leave the review process at the Journal of Vibration and Control up to chance. He set up scores of fake identities in their online submission database, with as many as 130 fabricated e-mail addresses, and guess who got to review his manuscripts? 
 The journal has retracted sixty papers going back to 2010, and I'd like to know if that's the record. I haven't heard of anything better - well, worse, you know what I mean. The professor involved has been removed from his position in Taiwan, as well he might, and the editor of the journal has resigned. As well he might, too - that editor is not implicated in the publication scam, as far as I can tell, but what exactly were his editorial duties? Dozens of papers come pouring in every year from some obscure university in Taiwan, all of them with overlapping lead or co-authors, and you don't even so much as look up from your desk? Hardly a month goes by without another bulletin from the wildly productive engineers at Pingtung U, sometimes four or five of the damn things at once, and you think you're doing your job? And nobody else who reads this journal - assuming anyone ever does - wonders what's going on, either? 
 If the professor involved was really getting something out of this (tenure, promotion, grant money, what have you), then the people who awarded those to him were idiots, too. In fact, that's how I'd sum up the whole affair: a fool, faking papers for a bunch of incompetents, and rewarded for it by idiots. What a crew. You really cannot underestimate the low end of the scientific publishing industry, nor its customers.
