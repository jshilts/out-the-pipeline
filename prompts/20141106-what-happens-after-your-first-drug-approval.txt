What Happens After Your First Drug Approval
6 Nov 2014

What happens to drug companies after they get their first drug approved? A new paper (http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.drudis.2014.10.013) coming out in Drug Discovery Today has an answer to that question: most of them never do it again. 
 Author Michael Kinch (Washington U.) has gone back through the records since the 1930s, and some interesting trends emerge. Up until the 1970s, the likelihood was that a company would go on to get a second approval, but then the odds began to go down. The reason is that in recent decades, nearly two-thirds of the companies that get their first approval go on to be acquired by someone else , and thus disappear from the list. It takes, on average, six to eight years for a second approval to come along after a company's first, and most companies aren't around long enough for that to happen any more. 
 Where will new drugs come from? Start-up companies are often dismantled following their acquisition, particularly if they are purchased by the subset of companies that market products but does not directly perform new drug discovery. This generally occurs within a year or two following acquisitions. From an optimistic standpoint, such turbidity recycles experienced personnel and allows them to join other organizations and begin afresh. Realistically, the dismantling of successful teams does not seem an efficient use of time or resources when viewed from a business or global public health perspective. 
 True, but I'm of two minds about that. I don't think that what happens to a lot of small companies (being shucked like ears of corn) is such a great thing, either. But it's worth remembering that for many of them, this was their business plan - to be acquired. The folks who put up the venture capital that went into these companies were hoping for just such an outcome, and the people working there were not, for the most part, taken by surprise. 
 Another thing to keep in mind is that a lot of economic activity looks wasteful from a calm, utilitarian perspective. That's Schumpeter's "creative destruction", which (never forget) really does involve destruction. The money obtained from these takeovers goes on to fund the next generation of small companies. It's a way of getting a return on capital inside a realistic amount of time. Imagine the thought experiment where we make it illegal for a small drug company to be acquired after its first drug approval: what happens then? My guess is that many fewer small companies get started, because a big part of the possible returns to the investors have now been closed off. (And perhaps we'd eventuallys see an article in Drug Discovery Today about the percentage of small companies who were only able to get their one drug on the market and could never follow up on it). 
 It would be interesting to know if this system has grown into such a form as drug discovery has gotten more difficult over the years - which is the main driving force, I'd say, for the likelihood of being taken over having risen. Are there perhaps more small companies being formed because this is such a likely outcome? 
 So yeah, the current system is wasteful and disruptive, but what are we comparing it to? I still can't come up with a better alternative - it's like Churchill's crack about democracy
