How Are Those Megamergers Working Out?
3 Dec 2014

Given today's bad news from GlaxoSmithKline, what an excellent time it is to revisit this infuriating McKinsey Consulting report (http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/health_systems_and_services/why_pharma_megamergers_work) on "Why pharma megamergers work", published earlier this year. 
 Uh-huh. That's the title. You thought that they disrupted the entire company, from top to bottom? Sowed fear and uncertainty? Hurt productivity? Au contraire . As the authors say, "These critiques have some merit but ignore larger points: megamergers have created significant value for shareholders, and some of these deals have been critical for the longer-term sustainability of acquirers." How do we know this? Why, by analyzing the returns for two to five years post-deal, that's how. This in an industry with ten-to-fifteen year timelines for new drugs to make it to market. That's McKinsey's idea of long-term value creation, apparently.
