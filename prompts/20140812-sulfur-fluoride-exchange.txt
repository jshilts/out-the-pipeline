Sulfur Fluoride Exchange
12 Aug 2014

Barry Sharpless and his group have another addition (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201309399/abstract) to the "click" list: the reactions of sulfonyl fluorides. They're not compounds that too many people have encountered, and you might think that they react roughly like their familiar sulfonyl chloride counterparts. But they go off in a completely different direction in many cases. 
 I ran into this reactivity some years ago when I was making a series of sulfone derivatives. If you try to make sulfones by adding an organolithium to a sulfonyl chloride, you're going to be disappointed. You might get a little of the chloro derivative of the lithium reagent, but you won't get any sulfones. But sulfonyl fluorides do the straight nucleophilic substitution on the sulfur and give you the desired product. Stuart McCombie, who was down the hall from me at the time, put me on to that reaction, which he'd come across some years before himself. The fluorides themselves could be prepared conveniently from KF and the sulfonyl chloride (Sharpless has a better route, I should add, one that won't displace all the other electrophiles in the substrate). 

This new paper shows that sulfonyl fluorides are capable of a number of reactions that are all their own, and that this reactivity extends all the way to sulfonyl sulfuryl fluoride itself. Inconveniently for chemists, that one's a gas, as opposed to the chloride (but that does make it widely used as a fumigant for termites). It does nothing when you expose it to water, for example, and under many conditions it's really quite unreactive. But it turns out to react with phenols very smoothly to give fluorosulfate esters whose further reactions are explored as well. The paper also mentions the uses of vinylsulfonyl fluoride, which was reported in 1979 (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jo01336a022) to be a tremendous Michael acceptor (which one can believe). It may, in fact, be the Michael acceptor, reacting exhaustively with basic amines of all types within minutes. It's also shown that aryl silyl ethers react with sulfonyl fluorides very cleanly to produce unsymmetrical diarylsulfates, another class of compound that has not been well explored, probably because they're not easily prepared from sulfonyl chloride. 
 So there's a whole set of new reactions here, along with some nearly forgotten ones that deserved to be hauled back out into the light. The diarylsulfate click reaction alone should prove useful on tyrosines and other biological phenols, as well as providing a whole class of materials that have really never been explored, and there's a lot more here as well. I remember digging around in the older German literature on this stuff back in the early 1990s when I was doing the sulfone chemistry, but the fact that I was looking at a useful (and almost totally neglected) area of synthesis didn't register on me. At times like this, a person feels that a lot of stuff must have not registered on them over the years!
