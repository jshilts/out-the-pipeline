Put Down That White-Out; Drop That Photoshop Cursor
4 Feb 2014

I've had some e-mails about this today: an impressive series of six corrections in Organic Letters (scroll down here (http://pubs.acs.org/toc/orlef7/0/0) ). I guess Amos Smith was serious about his editorial last year (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/07/16/touching_up_the_spectra) on manipulation of spectra. All of these corrections are for NMR cleanup of just that variety (disappearing solvent and impurity peaks, along with restated reaction yields). We'll see if it can encourager les autres (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Minorca_(1756)) . 
 Update: See Arr Oh asks (http://justlikecooking.blogspot.com/2014/02/fukuyama-mea-culpa-in-organic-letters.html) if the Fukuyama lab jumped, or were they pushed?
