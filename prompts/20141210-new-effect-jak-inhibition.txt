A New Effect From JAK Inhibition
10 Dec 2014

Here's an interesting paper (http://www.nature.com/ncb/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ncb3075.html#affil-auth) for people into metabolic disease: the authors report that JAK1/3 inhibitors (such as ​ tofacitinib (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tofacitinib) ) seem to cause human adipocytes to convert from their normal phenotype into brown fat, a different beast altogether (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_adipose_tissue) . Brown adipocytes are thermoregulators, and burn off lipids at an impressive rate. Many are the therapeutic approaches in metabolism that have targeted this pathway, but no one's every gotten into the real world. 
 Reading this paper, I wonder if it has something to do with irisin, a hormone that's also been reported (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/02/07/irisin_and_metabolism_a_new_target_emerges) to mediate this white-to-brown conversion. (No mention of it in the paper, though). JAK inhibition, in this case, seems to activate the Hedgehog pathway, which mediates the switchover. Of course, it mediates much more besides that, which is the problem here. As the authors themselves say: 
 The utility of JAK inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for obesity is complicated by the well-described role of this signalling pathway in the immune system. In fact, ​tofacitinib is approved in the United States to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, if one were to imagine targeting adipose tissue by in vivo administration of an IFN–JAK–STAT inhibitor or similar compound it would almost certainly need to be delivered locally and prevented from spreading systemically or alternatively targeted selectively to white adipocytes. One could also conceive of a cell-based therapy wherein JAK inhibition of patient-derived adipocytes ex vivo is followed by transplantation to treat obesity, but this therapeutic modality would need to overcome numerous and significant obstacles before becoming a reality. A further limitation of the current study is the lack of evidence that JAK inhibition would promote metabolic browning in vivo, in particular in humans where evidence supporting this phenomenon is scant. Thus, additional research is required before inhibition of IFN–JAK–STAT signalling could be used therapeutically for the treatment of metabolic disorders. 
 There is another take-away from this work that could be of broad use, though - it relies on human adipocytes derived from a stem cell line, which seem to be, as the authors put it, "inexhaustible and rapidly expandable source of human adipocytes for screening and downstream assays". I suspect we'll see plenty of further phenotypic screening with them. Oh, and just as an aside, given my earlier post (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/12/10/ambition_from_recursion) this morning: this is just the sort of thing that one might expect a discovery platform like Recursion's might pick up, if they're lucky. And it's just the sort of thing that might, in turn, keep them from discovering ten drugs a year, too.
