Novo Nordisk Braves the Obesity Market
4 Nov 2014

Everyone thinks of Novo Nordisk as a diabetes company (and that they are), but they're willing to use their expertise in related areas. And if you know a lot about insulin and blood sugar regulation, you may also end up knowing a fair amount about appetite and satiety signaling in the gut. The company has been developing a new dosage form of their Victoza ( liraglutide (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liraglutide) ) peptide drug for just that purpose, and it seems to be working in the clinic. 
 Liraglutide is a long-acting GLP-1 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1) analog, and decreased appetite is already noted with compounds of this type. Novo is out with more Phase III data (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/novo-nordisks-first-foray-obesity-comes-through-phase-iii/2014-11-04) , and they look pretty strong. An FDA advisory panel meeting last month went very well, and they seem to be on target to head into the obesity market. 
 And it'll be interesting to watch what happens then. As an injectable, liraglutide isn't going to be something that people just take casually, but who knows, that might prompt better patient compliance and a bit more dedication to the other diet and exercise factors in weight loss, since you're already going to that much trouble. Obesity therapies have had a rough time (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2010/07/23/vivus_qnexa_arena_lorcaserin_and_the_fda) in the market over the last few years, with Vivus, Orixigen, and Arena all struggling with their individual drugs. (All three of those stocks have fanatic followings, I might add, and I feel sure to hear from some of those folks just for having mentioned the companies). Will Novo's drug (renamed Saxenda for this market) have a better fate? (Some of that will depend, in the long run, on whether there are any problems with higher liraglutide doses, but so far, things look OK). And if it does, will it knock out one or more of the smaller players?
