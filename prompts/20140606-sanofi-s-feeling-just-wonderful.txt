Sanofi's Feeling Just Wonderful
6 Jun 2014

Chris Viehbacher of Sanofi has an interview (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-05/sanofi-chief-sees-no-reason-to-join-pharma-m-a-frenzy.html) with reporters from Bloomberg, where he says some interesting things. Such as "Unlike everybody else, we feel we’ve got critical mass in all of our businesses" and ". . .at today’s prices I don’t see anything that I can acquire that strengthens our company and creates value for our shareholders." So that's good news, I'd have to say. 
 He also notes that the recent Pfizer/AstraZeneca tango might possibly be an indication that pharma investors are willing to wait rather than take the money and run. I hope that's right, but I don't see how human psychology has changed much. My fear is that AstraZeneca might have oversold their internal prospects in the process of fighting off Pfizer. It's not like their shareholders decided to turn down their desire for an immediate profit; it's that the company did a more thorough job of appealing to it. We'll see how well that works. 
 Viehbacher also says, about Sanofi, that "I am feeling great about what we have; I haven’t felt this great in years." Doesn't he know that saying things like this is tempting the gods? I swear, powerful deities are at this very moment reaching for their bottles of laxative and limbering up. You say these things, and next thing you know people in your phase III trials are starting to turn orange right in front of your eyes. It's just not safe. 
 But Viehbacher is not known for his restraint in interviews, as this 2012 example (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/03/01/what_sanofi_thinks_about_you) made clear. That one ended up with a luckless Sanofi PR person showing up at this site (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/03/02/a_response_from_sanofi) to try to explain things. Let's see how much luck they have spinning the Wrath of the Pharma Gods!
