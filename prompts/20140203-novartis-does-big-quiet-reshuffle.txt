Novartis Does A Big, Quiet Reshuffle
3 Feb 2014

That AstraZeneca news about cutting back in India should be balanced against this report (http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/nzz-novartis-will-cut-or-move-4000-jobs-many-india/2014-02-02) that Novartis is doing the opposite. It looks like the company is (A) telling everyone that their global head count will remain roughly the same, and (B) opening up a center in Hyderabad that can employ up to 8,000 people. 
 These jobs don't look like bench positions, though - more IT, clinical trial monitoring, HR and other office positions. But if both of those conditions hold, there's going to be a lot of reshuffling going on, from higher-wage areas to Hyderabad. Economically, it makes sense, as long as there aren't too many inefficiencies introduced along the way. And like every other arbitrage opportunity, it will go on until the price differential closes, which I hope, for everyone involved, is more a matter of wages going up as India's economy improves.
