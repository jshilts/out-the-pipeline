Sarepta's Duchenne Therapy Is A Lot Further Away
27 Oct 2014

I wrote here (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/11/13/sareptas_approval_woes) about Sarepta, a small company having plenty of difficulty getting a therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy through the FDA. At that point, the problem was the accelerated-approval pathway, but things have now gotten a good deal worse (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/sarepta-plunges-ceo-moves-goal-line-fdas-duchenne-drug-decision-downfield/2014-10-27) . 
 Following a meeting with regulators in September, the biotech spelled out a new set of data that the FDA is looking for in the application, and the biotech says it will have to delay filing--another dramatic turning point for the company this year, which saw its shares plunge 30% on the news this morning. 
 Sarepta shares have been on a roller coaster ride over the past two years as the company was forced repeatedly to move the goal lines on a prospective approval for the drug, which so far has registered promising data from a tiny study involving only a dozen boys. The biotech today spelled out regulators' demands for imaging and longterm results as well as more safety data, all of which will stall the company until at least mid-2015--or longer. 
 To make matters worse, the CEO has been telling investors that the agency was much more favorable, and in fact was strongly considering an early approval for the drug even before any Phase III results came in. Those investors are deeply unhappy now, and the parents of the potential patients even more so. This whole situation is a terrible mess, and honestly, it looks as if it could have been avoided. From outside, Sarepta seems to have been trying to make far too much of a single small study (12 boys, and the data only looked good when you excluded two of them). You have to provide convincing data in this business, and that takes time and costs money. Trying to take shortcuts is a low-percentage move.
