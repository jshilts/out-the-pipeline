What If Drug Patents Were Written Like Software Patents?
20 Jun 2014

Try this claim on for size and see how it fits: 
 "A method for treating a human disease state by means of inhibiting an enzyme whose functioning contributes to that disease state, said means comprising the administration of a molecule of molecular weight between 100 and 750 Daltons (composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and optionally sulfur and/or one or more halogen atoms) that has been determined to interact with the enzyme in such a way as to disturb, inhibit, or alter its function." 
 Not happening, that one, and it's a good thing. But stuff nearly that vague and idiotic is all over the software patent landscape (http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2014/06/supreme-court-limits-software-patents-reasonably.html) . Such patents list a superficially impressive amount of detail about how their "invention" is to be implemented, but all too often, that scheme turns out to mean something like "Someone uses a computer to contact a web server" or "Someone turns on their mobile phone". It would be as if we in the drug industry could enable our compounds by citing a few synthetic organic chemistry textbooks - that's how you make 'em, right there! 
 But the Supreme Court has begun the task of diverting a river through this particular manure-laden stable in a 9-0 decision, Alice Corp. v. CLS (http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-298_7lh8.pdf) . Justice Thomas delivered the opinion: 
 The patents at issue in this case disclose a computer-implemented scheme for mitigating “settlement risk” (i.e., the risk that only one party to a financial transaction will pay what it owes) by using a third-party intermediary. The question presented is whether these claims are patent eligible under 35 U. S. C. §101, or are instead drawn to a patent-ineligible abstract idea. We hold that the claims at issue are drawn to the abstract idea of intermediated settlement, and that merely requiring generic computer implementation fails to transform that abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention. . . 
 The opinion starts off by detailing why the patents under question are directed towards an abstract idea, and then goes on to demolish the contention that the method claims turn that into something patentable. All they do, the court says, is instruct someone to go off and use a computer to implement that idea (of an intermediated financial settlement), which in no way makes that idea eligible for a patent. Eventually, there will probably come a case that forces the court to propose a test for what constitutes an abstract idea, but I'll bet that all nine justices hope to be retired by the time that happens. Update: for more on this and other issues associated with this case, see this discussion (http://www.patentdocs.org/2014/06/thoughts-on-alice-corp-v-cls-bank-intl.html) at Patent Docs. 
 The opinion cites a number of other recent patent decisions by the court, such as Mayo v. Prometheus (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/03/21/the_supreme_court_makes_me_smile) Mayo v. Prometheus and Assoc. Mol. Pathology v. Myriad (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/06/13/the_supreme_court_rules_on_myriad) Assoc. Mol. Pathology v. Myriad . One gets the impression that the Supreme Court is engaged in a multiyear, multicase (http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/20/us-usa-court-ip-analysis-idUSKBN0EU2SV20140620) effort to clean up some persistent problems in US patent law, and that this process will continue.
