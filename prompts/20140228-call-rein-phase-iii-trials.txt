A Call To Rein In Phase III Trials
28 Feb 2014

Here's a very nice perspective (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1400868?query=TOC&) on what gets funded in drug research and why. Robert Kocher and Bryan Roberts bring their venture-capital viewpoint (Venrock) to the readers of the NEJM : 
 It is not mysterious why projects get funded. As venture-capital investors, we evaluate projects along four primary dimensions: development costs, selling costs, differentiation of the drug relative to current treatments, and incidence and prevalence of the targeted disease (see table (http://www.nejm.org/action/showImage?doi=10.1056%2FNEJMp1400868&iid=t01) ). For a project to be attractive, it needs to be favorably reviewed on at least two of these dimensions. Many drugs designed for orphan diseases and cancers are good investments of scarce capital, since they tend to have relatively low development costs and selling costs and to be strongly differentiated from the current treatment options. Conversely, investors are less likely to fund drugs with much higher development and selling costs (e.g., drugs for type 2 diabetes or psychiatric disorders) and drugs that cannot be strongly differentiated from current treatment options — often because low-cost generics are available to treat the targeted condition — despite the condition's high incidence and prevalence (e.g., drugs for hypertension or hypercholesterolemia). 
 Since improving the rate of discovery is a rather knotty, multivariate problem, the authors turn to the economic back end of the process. They make the case for the FDA to move more towards conditional approvals, since no Phase III trial can be large enough (or long-running enough) to pick up on all the "long tail" adverse events that might be waiting out there. Current Phase III trials, they say, are often overpowered for efficacy but are still underpowered for rare events, so we're spending a lot of money rather inefficiently. 
 I think they've got a good point, but the FDA already gets enough flak as it is. Changing things in this way, if done too quickly (and frankly, if done too openly) would be seen by many as a bean-counting technique to shift the risk onto the paying customers. Can't you hear it now? But the world they describe would be a good one, if it's feasible: 
 We estimate that development costs for drugs could be reduced by as much as 90%, and the time required by 50%, if the threshold for initial approval were defined in terms of efficacy and fundamental safety. Cutting costs and time, while requiring high-quality and transparent patient registries for independent safety monitoring, would be a more informative and cost-effective approach. With the widespread adoption of electronic health records and the introduction of many low-cost data-analysis tools, it is now feasible to develop mandatory postmarketing surveillance programs that make thousand-patient trials obsolete. Large data sets would also inoculate drug makers against spurious claims such as the false association of pancreatitis with the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. At the same time, it is essential to empower the FDA to quickly remove or restrict the use of drugs when safety signals emerge from the improved data and safety monitoring. 
 This moves beyond clinical science and into politics, which (as the cliché has it) is the art of the possible. Even if we agree that this move is desirable, is it possible, or not?
