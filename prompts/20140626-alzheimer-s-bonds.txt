Alzheimer's Bonds
26 Jun 2014

I wrote a couple of years ago (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/10/02/a_totally_new_way_to_finance_drug_discovery) about Andrew Lo of MIT, and his idea for securitization of drug discovery. For those of you who aren't financial engineers, that means raising funds by issuing securities (bonds and the like), and that's something that (as far as I know) has never been used to fund any specific drug development project. 
 Now Pharmalot has an update (http://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2014/06/25/should-alzheimers-bonds-be-issued-to-fund-drug-development/) in an interview with Lo (who's recently published a paper (http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/6/241/241cm5) on the idea in Science Translational Medicine ). In particular, he's talking about issuing "Alzheimer's bonds", to pick a disease with no real therapies, a huge need for something, and gigantic cost barriers to finding something. Lo's concerned that the risks are too high for any one company to take on (and Eli Lilly might agree with him eventually), and wants to have some sort of public/private partnership floating the bonds. 
 We would create a fund that issues bonds. But if the private sector isn’t incentivized on its own, maybe the public sector can be incentivized to participate along with some members of the private sector. I will explain. But let’s look at the costs for a moment. The direct cost of treating the disease – never mind home care and lost wages – to Medicare and Medicaid for 2014 is estimated at $150 billion. We did a calculation and asked ourselves what kind of rate of return can we expect? We came up with $38.4 billion over 13 years. . . 
 . . .Originally, I thought it could come from the private sector. We’d create a fund – a mega fund of private investors, such as hedge funds, pension, various institutional investors. The question we asked ourselves is will they get a decent rate of return over a 13-year period? The answer, which is based on a best guess, given the risks of development and 64 projects, and we believed the answer was ‘no.’ It wouldn’t be like cancer or orphan diseases. It’s just not going to work. I come from that world. I talked to funds, philanthropists, medical experts. We did a reality check to see if we were off base. And it sounded like it would be difficult to create a fund to develop real drugs and still give investors a reasonable rate of return – 15% to 20%. 
 He's now going around to organizations like the Alzheimer's Association to see if there's some interest in giving this a try. I think that it's going to be a hard sell, but I'd actually like to see it happen. The difficulty is that there's no way to do this just a little bit to see if it works: you have to do it on a large scale to have any hope of success at all, and it's a big leap. In fact, the situation reminds one of. . .the situation with any given Alzheimer's drug idea. The clinical course of the disease, as we understand it now, does not give you any options other than a big, long, expensive path through the clinic (which is why it's the perfect example of an area where all the risk is concentrated on the expensive late stages). Lo is in the position of trying to address the go-big-or-go-home problem of Alzheimer's research with a remedy that requires investors to go big or go home. 
 The hope is that you could learn enough along the way to change the risk equation in media res . There's an old science fiction story by A. E. van Vogt, "Far Centaurus", which featured (among other things - van Vogt stories generally had several kitchen sinks included) a multidecade suspended-animation expedition to Alpha Centauri. The crew arrive there to find the planets already covered with human-populated cities, settled by the faster-than-light spaceships that were invented in the interim. We don't need FTL to fix Alzheimer's (fortunately), but there could be advances that would speed up the later parts of Lo's fund. But will this particular expedition ever launch?
