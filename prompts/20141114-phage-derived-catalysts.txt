Phage-Derived Catalysts
14 Nov 2014

I've been enjoying this recent paper (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja509393p) in JACS , but then I always like to see intersections of molecular biology with organic synthesis. The authors, from CUNY and the University of Strathclyde, are using a phage display library to see if they can come up with displayed peptide combinations that are catalytic. Specifically, they're trying to form an amide bond from a primary amine and a methyl ester, which at RT in water is going to be a pretty slow process. (But as numerous enzymes show, it's certainly capable of being accelerated). 
 The phages display five copies of a 12-mer peptide sequence, and they have about 3 billion different sequences in the library. That alone is why I'm always interested in phage display, DNA-encoded libraries, and the like: the sheer number of combinations that can be worked with. There aren't three billion reported organic compounds in the history of the human race - maybe one-twentieth that number. But there are three billion in that Eppendorf vial over there. The problem is to tell the few that you want from the billions that you don't, and that's where the molecular biology really kicks in. 
 In this case, though, the authors used an ingenious trick to find the phages that would catalyze their reaction. The reacting partners were Fmoc-threonine and leucine methyl ester, and the product peptide is so insoluble that it tends to aggregate around the business end of the phage that's producing it. Careful centrifugation of the mixture, then, will give you a heavier band of phage(s) with more apparent weight, and treatment of those with subtilisin cleaves all those methyl esters and allows the stuck peptides to be washed off. Those phages are then taken back into E. coli and amplified for another round, and after a couple of cycles, they sequenced samples of the phages that had been selected. 
 To control for possible things happening to that methyl ester along the way, they did the same sorts of experiment with leucineamide, this time using acetonitrile/water to wash off the formed peptides from the phages, rather than hydrolyzing the methyl esters. Comparing the sequences from all these selections shows. . .well, a lot of variation. There aren't any obvious similarities, either among the phages identified in the two experiments, or between the ester/amide ones. But the selected phages do tend to catalyze amide formation; that much seems clear. One difficulty is that the amide formation appears self-limiting, since the aggregating product gums up the region doing the catalysis (the differences in aggregation in that area between active phages and inactive ones can be seen in electron microscopy images). 
 So you can apparently find catalytically active proteins, even just in repeated dodecapeptide displays. And there are apparently a number of different ways for them to be active (thus the sequence variability). This work reminds me of a phage-display paper I blogged about (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/04/18/a_short_peptide_and_a_small_molecule) last year, where the authors were searching for molecular recognition sequences. (Note, though, that as pointed out in the comments, the binding data in that paper are not as compelling as they should be). 
 So we have some evidence that phage-display peptides could have applications in organic chemistry, but there's nothing conventionally useful yet. The techniques being used are still probably not exerting enough selection pressure. In the current paper, the selected phages definitely stand out from random background, but they're not exactly artificial ribosomes, either. Maybe it's the fairly simple nature of the phage display, or the product inhibition. I can't help but think that there are useful and interesting things out there in those crazy billions of phage-derived peptides, although it's worth remembering that the three billion peptides in this experiment are still only about one-millionth of the possible number of 12-mer sequences. We still need better ways to produce, select, and evaluate them. 
 Update: Paul D. in the comments put me onto a company I hadn't been aware of, Siluria. They've been using phage display as a screening platform to product new inorganic catalysts, a sort of combinatorial biomineralization process, that seems to be yielding results. Here's an article (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074552110003170) on them, and here's a note (http://www.greencarcongress.com/2014/06/20140602-siluria.html) on the progress in their methane-to-ethylene process.
