Pharma and Ebola
17 Sep 2014

So, Ebola. A terrible virus, with a high mortality rate. And although that percentage is raised by the poor public health infrastructure in the areas where it's endemic, it's still very bad news indeed, a major medical challenge anywhere it might show up. The current outbreak in West Africa is by far the largest yet, which makes prediction of its course difficult. One can hope that the virus will mutate to a less ferocious form, as often happens with host/pathogen systems, but (1) that could take a long time, and (2) there's no guarantee that it would help much. After all, polio and smallpox had been infecting humans for a long time, and were still awful enough. There's also a small (but non-zero) chance that a mutation could go the other way, and make the virus easier to spread by airborne routes, to pick one worrisome possibility, in which case we're all going to long for the good old days when Ebola was only as bad as it is now. 
 With those cheerful thoughts in mind, what does the biopharma industry have to offer against the disease? As I mentioned regarding avian influenza several years ago (http://www.corante.com/pipeline/archives/2005/02/21/can_medchem_help_with_bird_flu.php) , we can probably cross off most small-molecule therapies. Not very many antiviral drugs have a broad enough mechanism to go after Ebola as well as their designed targets, and there are no small molecules on the market that have been aimed at Ebola itself. As with many infectious diseases, immune-system therapies are a better bet - antibodies and the like for acute treatment, and vaccines as the best hope for prevention. Famously, there is a potential Ebola antibody in development (more on this in another post, and as we get some more details on the work itself), but there is (equally famously) no such thing yet as an Ebola vaccine yet, although there's a GSK/NIH venture that not many people had heard about until this latest outbreak. 
 You can realize all this, as the Independent newspaper did in England, and write a big story (http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/ebola-outbreak-big-pharma-failed-victims-why-9716615.html) about how Big Pharma has been callous and negligent. But once you scroll down that one, you'll find in the comments section that the main source for the article is quite unhappy with it: 
 his article claims that I, Adrian Hill, have “ launched a devastating attack on Big Pharm, accusing drugs giants including GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Sanofi, Merck and Pfizer of failing to manufacture a vaccine, not because it was impossible, but because there was no business case.” I did no such thing. 
 I simply explained to Mr Cooper what is widely known in the biomedical research and development community: that vaccine development is extremely expensive, usually takes a very long time and the market is dominated by some very large pharma companies. Because outbreaks of diseases such as Ebola are rare and unpredictable and, until now, have afflicted small numbers of people in very poor countries, it is widely understood that that is no business case for a private company to invest tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in vaccine development for such diseases. It may be the Independent’s view that this is a telling indictment of the global pharmaceutical industry, but it is not mine and I am unhappy that the first paragraph of this report wrongly attributes that view to me. 
 Adrian Hill is completely correct. Until this latest outbreak, there have been far, far larger pubic health problems in Africa than Ebola. Not even the deepest-pocketed NGO or most open-hearted charity would have been able to make a good case for putting large amounts of money behind an Ebola vaccine effort - in fact, such a project would almost certainly have been a criminal misuse of funds. There are just too many other things that have caused (and are causing) death and disease in these areas - until this year, the number of people killed by Ebola was trivial compared to the number being killed by a host of other factors. In fact, the number of people being infected now by Ebola is pretty damned small compared to the other public health problems in the poorest parts of West Africa - just to stick with the infectious diseases alone, you have malaria, yellow fever, schistosomiasis, dengue, typhoid, hepatitis A, meningococcus, and just plain diarrhea (a killer for young children). Ebola doesn't deserve the current level of attention just because of the number of people it's killed - the number of people in Liberia who've died before their time over the last ten or twenty years is horrific, and it wasn't Ebola that killed them. It deserves attention because we don't know how bad this outbreak is going to get, and because it's already (and understandably) causing huge amounts of fear and disruption, given its high mortality rate. If cases continue to show up inside the larger cities, things could get out of control pretty quickly. 
 The NIH (specifically, the NIAID) has funded (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/ebolamarburg/research/pages/default.aspx) a number of Ebola research programs in the US, and I would guess that many of these have been directed, at least partly, to possible bioterror threats. It's also worthwhile to figure out how to develop a vaccine against a class of viruses that no one's tackled before, since there are bound to be some lessons learned that can be applied again. Okairos, a small Swiss-based company spun out of Merck, has been working (http://www.okairos.com/e/inners.php?m=00088) on a vaccine along with the NIH as well, and they were recently acquired by GSK. (This one is the focus of a great deal of suddenly accelerated (http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/17/us-health-ebola-vaccine-idUSKBN0HC17E20140917) work). 
 But no, the big companies have not spent time working on an Ebola vaccine until now. And as Hill says, this should not come as a surprise. By the WHO's count (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/) , from 1976 through 2012 there had been a total of 1590 human fatalities from Ebola, with whole years going by without a single case. There is not enough research money in the world to work on everything at this level, or at least, not without taking away from everything else.
