Stem Cells: The Center of
20 Jun 2014

I wanted to point out an excellent editorial (http://www.nature.com/news/regulation-sell-help-not-hope-1.15409) on the whole "Right to Try" issue (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/06/10/right_to_try_here_we_go) at Nature . The authors note correctly that stem cells are the therapeutic area where these battles are being fought most often, since their regulatory status (particularly with any sort of autologous cell treatment) is sometimes unclear, the number of possible treatments (well-intentioned and otherwise) is huge, and the medical need is even bigger. 
 Many countries have made such experimental stem cell treatments more widely available without proof of efficacy. We're not just talking about the usual "medical tourism" list, although those countries are certainly on this one, but places like Japan and Australia. That cuts both ways. Proponents of the idea say that these countries are making more progress than the US for this reason, but a look at what's happened since these regulations were loosened isn't always encouraging. It's very, very, hard to open up such trials without opening them up to the sort of people who will gladly exploit patients for as long as possible (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/03/02/stem_cells_in_texas_quite_the_business) without caring if any efficacy is ever proven or not. 
 Even the idea of putting products up for sale and into consumers' bodies on the basis of phase I data is disturbing. Early-stage clinical trials reveal only whether a product is safe enough for continued testing, not for widespread use. Some 80% of products that make it through phase I clinical trials fail in later studies — about half of those proving to be insufficiently effective and one-fifth insufficiently safe. 
 When test subjects are paying for the product under investigation, establishing efficacy is hard: controls, randomization, masking and other hallmarks of clinical research break down. Many stem-cell clinics offer their procedures for disparate conditions, further complicating post-market studies. 
 Under the guise of 'patient-funded clinical trials', clinics in the United States and Mexico persuade people who are seriously ill to pay tens of thousands of dollars for procedures. Because such patients have been told that a product is experimental, they have little recourse when hoped-for cures fail to materialize. Companies can thus profit from selling hope. With their products already on the market, they have little reason to conduct rigorous, conclusive research. 
 Stem cells, as has been said many times on this side, are surely one of the most overhyped (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/01/04/osiris_and_their_stem_cells) areas in all of medical research. This has been true for at least ten years now, and the hype does not die down. Some may remember that this was an issue during the 2004 presidential election. I'll bet if you took a poll back then and asked where the field would be by 2014, that the general public would have bet on it being much more advanced than it is now. The usual reason applies: it's because this area of research is extremely, inhumanly complicated and difficult , but people get tired of hearing that and think that it's an excuse for some other factor. 
 There are libertarian and free-market groups behind several of the legal initiatives in the US, who honestly believe that the current FDA structure is an impediment to medical progress, and that this sort of deregulation will end up helping more people more quickly. I believe that their motives are sincere - not everyone pushing these ideas is looking for a quick buck. But the people who aren't need to look around and realize how many quick-buck artists are surrounding them. Every libertarian reform needs to have someone thinking "OK, less regulation and more freedom of choice, check. But what are the ways that this could be abused by unscrupulous SOBs? Can those abuses mount up to where they cancel out the good that's done on the other end?" 
 In this case, I think that danger is very real, and very likely. As opposed to the caricatures that you hear from people on the left end of the political spectrum, many free-market types, in my experience, have good hearts. Perhaps too good, in some cases. It would never occur to them personally to immediately turn around and use this newly loosened regulatory environment to start looting desperately ill people of their money. But it sure would occur to some others. Homo homini lupus : man is a wolf to man.
