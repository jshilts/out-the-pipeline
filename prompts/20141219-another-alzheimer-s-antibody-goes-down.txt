Another Alzheimer's Antibody Goes Down
19 Dec 2014

The clinical failure rate for disease-modifying Alzheimer's therapies remains perfect, unfortunately: a flat 100%. The latest news (http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-12-19/roche-scraps-alzheimer-s-drug-trial-on-disappointing-results) is from Roche. Their in-licensed amyloid-targeting antibody (gantenerumab, from MorphoSys) came up empty on an interim trial analysis. Other trials are apparently continuing, but with what hopes? 
 Roche's rationale seems to be that these other trials are targeting milder and/or earlier forms of Alzheimer's. And it's true that if an antibody approach is going to show something, those are probably the patients where it will. (There are a number of such trials going on now (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/10/12/another_prospective_alzheimers_trial) ). But the odds are very long. And the situation is complicated by companies wanting to get something, anything, out of these extremely expensive drug development efforts - and by many scientists who have committed their research careers to the amyloid hypothesis. Add in the terribly slow clinical readouts in any Alzheimer's trial and the large and desperate market for anything that works, and you have a tough landscape indeed.
