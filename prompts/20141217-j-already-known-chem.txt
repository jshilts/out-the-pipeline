J. Already Known Chem.

A reader sent along this paper (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja5065735) , which recently appeared in JACS . He'd read it and was puzzled - not by the content of the paper, but as to "how it got into JACS". 
 So I had a look. It's on the peptide hormone oxyntomodulin (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxyntomodulin) , a 37-residue species closely related to glucagon which stimulates insulin release as an agonist at the GLP-1 receptor. As the authors correctly note, one big problem with trying to administer naturally-occurring hormones like this as drugs is their short half-live due to proteolysis. The body already has pathways to clear these things out, and if you want a longer-lasting effect, you're going to have to get around that. The paper says that the cleavage sites of oxyntomodulin have not been well assigned, so they added some to plasma and did a mass spec assay to see what fragments were produced. A new cleavage was found, one amino acid down from one reported for the DPP-IV protease, and this one doesn't seem to involve DPP-IV at all. None of the fragments are active at the GLP-1 receptor. Mutating two arginine residues at the cleavage site to alanine gave a peptide that was still active at the receptor. 
 In this case, the amino acid sequences required for efficient proteolysis of OXM are not involved in OXM activation of GLP1R, which made the preparation of an active peptide-hormone analog much easier. In other situations, it is likely that additional mutants will have to be prepared to maintain activity while limiting proteolysis. . .The fact that prOXM shows similar activity to OXM in these in vitro assays demonstrates that the identification and mutation of key cleavage sites is an efficient method for designing proteolysis-resistant hormone analogs. We also appreciate that simply mutating cleavage sites to alanine will not work in every case because this may disrupt the activity of the peptide and may not inhibit cleavage. 
 Yes, indeed. When others have done this, and many others have, that's often just what happens. This particular mutant does show more stability in plasma, though, and this carried over to a rodent in vivo experiment. But. . .well, as has been said, it needs no ghost come from the grave to tell us this. There's absolutely nothing wrong with this work, but this summary is a bit baffling: 
 Since nothing in this approach is specific to OXM, we think that this approach should be applicable to the preparation of numerous peptide hormone analogs with improved pharmacological properties. Filling the pipeline with more candidates will increase the chances of identifying novel next-generation biologic therapeutics based on peptide hormones. 
 "Should be applicable"? Unfortunately, "has been applicable for many, many years" would be more accurate. I would find this paper much easier to take if it didn't include phrases like this. I mean, identifying a cleavage site by mass spec and mutating the adjacent residues to alanine doesn't seem like the sort of thing that needs eight co-authors from Harvard and the Salk Institute, or (to be honest) the sort of thing that I expect to see in JACS . I have to agree with my correspondent. There is, as I said above, nothing wrong with any of this, but it strikes me as utterly routine, and the suggestion that it should be a way of "filling the pipeline" is going to be greeting by actual biopharma researchers with an exasperated eye-roll.
