Science Gifts 2014: General Books (and More) on Chemistry
2 Dec 2014

It's that time of year again! I wanted to go ahead and put up a few posts over the next few days with science- and chemistry-themed gift recommendations. Today will be books in the general chemistry category. 
 I've mentioned Theodore Gray's book The Elements (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1579128955/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1579128955&linkCode=as2&tag=lagniappe-20) before as an fine gift for anyone's who's interested in science or chemistry. I have a copy at home, although I still don't have the follow-up, the Elements Vault (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1579128807/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1579128807&linkCode=as2&tag=lagniappe-20) , which has some chemical samples in it (doubtless some of the more obtainable and less offensive elements!) 
 This year, Gray has a second volume out in what he says will be a trilogy: Molecules (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1579129714/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1579129714&linkCode=as2&tag=lagniappe-20&linkId=XVF2TPARWPX4E5VW) . I haven't seen this one yet in person, but it looks like it has high production values, and Chemjobber enjoyed (https://twitter.com/Chemjobber/status/530726026892963842) the accompanying iPad and iPhone app (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/molecules-by-theodore-gray/id923383841?mt=8&uo=4&at=11l9HU) . 
 Two years ago I ordered the companion Elements Jigsaw Puzzle (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1579128882/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1579128882&linkCode=as2&tag=lagniappe-20) , which I did with the kids during January and February, to produce a three-foot-wide periodic table with information and photographs of each element. Being the sort of person I am, I didn't miss the chance to teach a bit of chemistry along the way, based on personal experiences with quite a few of the elements themselves. Gray also has a deck of element cards (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1603761985/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1603761985&linkCode=as2&tag=lagniappe-20) and a calendar (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1579129412/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1579129412&linkCode=as2&tag=lagniappe-20) , for your decorating needs. 
 There are other good entries in this area. The Disappearing Spoon (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316051640/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0316051640&linkCode=as2&tag=lagniappe-20) is an entertaining book on various odd properties of the elements (chemists will have said "Gallium!" by now just after having seen the title). I haven't seen Periodic Tales (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061824739/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0061824739&linkCode=as2&tag=lagniappe-20) myself, but it comes well recommended. Readers here have also recommended Napoleon's Buttons: How 17 Molecules Changed History (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585423319/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1585423319&linkCode=as2&tag=lagniappe-20&linkId=ZAWYBDERDKHDMJY6) and the (out of print) 1959 The Romance of Chemistry (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0670604232/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0670604232&linkCode=as2&tag=lagniappe-20&linkId=5AVNVXBIFZLSVPA4) by Keith Irwin. 
 Update: Stuart Cantrill has a very good list (http://stuartcantrill.com/reading-list/) of popular-level science books here, and from that I'd like to add two by Thomas Hager that I've also heard good things about: The Alchemy of Air (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307351793/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307351793&linkCode=as2&tag=lagniappe-20&linkId=BHL2BO77ZVDCMBYU) , on the Haber-Bosch process and its effects on everything from feeding the world to the rise of Hitler, and The Demon Under the Microscope (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400082145/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1400082145&linkCode=as2&tag=lagniappe-20&linkId=GIAYSIAFHMKC54E6) , on the discovery of sulfanilamide. And fellow chem-blogger Wavefunction recommends Stuff Matters (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0241955181/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0241955181&linkCode=as2&tag=lagniappe-20&linkId=OHLW2UNUO6YYWARF) , a new book on materials science. 
 An inevitable subset of books on chemistry concentrates on the poisons. Readers here have recommended books by John Emsley, Molecules of Murder (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0854049657/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0854049657&linkCode=as2&tag=lagniappe-20&linkId=GP5E44UXQVJGAY6V) and The Elements of Murder (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0192806009/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0192806009&linkCode=as2&tag=lagniappe-20&linkId=5PYUCPLVK5YV4ZCJ) . Deborah Blum's The Poisoner's Handbook (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/014311882X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=014311882X&linkCode=as2&tag=lagniappe-20&linkId=J3AC5NEU6Y3YI7QW) has done very well since its publication. It originally had a number of errors in its chemistry, but looking at the current paperback, I see that things have been fixed in many cases. 
 A slightly different note is struck by another book I've long recommended, Oliver Sacks' Uncle Tungsten (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375704043/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0375704043&linkCode=as2&tag=lagniappe-20) , which is a memoir as well as a meditation on chemistry (and the love of chemistry). Another memoir, an episodic one, is of course the late Primo Levi's The Periodic Table (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805210415/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0805210415&linkCode=as2&tag=lagniappe-20) . It's somber at times, but also amusing, and when I read in it the phrase "Chlorides are rabble", I knew I was in the presence of a good writer, a good chemist, and a good translator. (As Wavefunction noted last year when I mentioned this book, Levi's text is not without mistakes, either, such as stating that Neil Bartlett won the Nobel for his noble gas fluoride discovery. Heshouldhave (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2008/09/16/neil_bartlett_19322008) should , and I'd bet that most people who know about it think that he did, but. . .)
