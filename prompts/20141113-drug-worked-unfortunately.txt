The Drug Worked, Unfortunately
13 Nov 2014

There's an old story of a guy who lost three cars by betting on inside straights in poker games. He lost the first two when he drew and didn't fill the hand - and he lost the third one when he did. In other words, you need to be sure that even if things work the way you want them to that they'll be enough, and that brings us to a company called Oxigene. 
 They've been working on fosbretabulin (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combretastatin_A-4_phosphate) for ovarian cancer. That's a phosphate prodrug (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2008/12/01/prodrugs_how_the_pros_do_it) of the known chemotherapy agent combretastatin A-4, and there's nothing wrong with that - prodrugs can dramatically change (http://pharmrev.aspetjournals.org/content/63/3/750.full) compound distribution and efficacy. The company has just reported (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/press-releases/oxigene-announces-presentation-phase-2-data-confirming-addition-fosbretabul) Phase II results in a tough group of patients to treat, recurrent ovarian cancer, and they have positive data. Progression-free survival was increased in the combo of fosbretabulin and Avastin compared to Avastin alone, and a post-hoc look at a smaller group whose cancer was resistant to platinum-containing agents seemed to show an even bigger effect. So far, so good. 
 But is it good enough? That's what Adam Feuerstein asked (http://www.thestreet.com/story/12949868/1/oxigene-faces-challenges-for-ovarian-cancer-drug-even-with-encouraging-data.html) at TheStreet.com. One big problem is that, interestingly, Avastin is not approved for this indication. So Oxigene's trial was not conducted versus the official standard of care. The company chose this, though, because Roche is running trials of its own to try to get approval in this area. And their numbers on Avastin plus standard chemotherapy look somewhat better than Oxigene's combination data, and in a larger trial at that. Put another way, if both the Roche and Oxigene data are solid, then Oxigene may have just proven its combo's inferiority. 
 As Feuerstein goes on to say, and he's absolutely right, Oxigene now faces some tough decisions in Phase III. Later this month, Roche may well get approval for that Avastin+chemo treatment in these patients, so that now becomes the obvious standard-of-care comparison for Oxigene. And if the Avastin combo doesn't get approved, then Oxigene is really up the creek, because all their clinical data will then have been generated with a drug that the FDA hasn't approved for the indication at all. Feuerstein has some advice for them (see his article), but it'll be a bold step. Update: the approval has come through (http://t.co/vkVKOnZoxx) . 
 Bold steps may be the only ones Oxigene has left, though. If the Roche trials had worked enough for approval, and Oxigene's own trial data had been superior to that in turn, they'd be in great shape. That didn't happen, and the quicker the company comes to terms with that situation, the better off they'll be.
