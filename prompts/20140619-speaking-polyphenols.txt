That's it over there at the left, and yeah, that sure is a polyphenol. In fact, it's a chaetochromin (http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.5144991.html) , a family of mycotoxins originally isolated from moldy rice. The paper doesn't say anything about its stereochemistry, but some can be inferred from their docking models. 
 Their compound, denoted 4548-G05, does seem to stimulate the insulin receptor, and the list of things that do that is not a long one. A small-molecule IR compound could be quite useful in diabetes patients, of course, but no one's every been able to come up with a plausible drug candidate. Merck made a big splash back in 1999 (http://www.sciencemag.org/content/284/5416/974.abstract) with another fungal metabolite, L-783,281, but that never became a drug, either. This new paper advances a hypothesis of where the polyphenol binds to the extracellular domain of the insulin receptor and how it might exert its actions. 
 I would wonder, though, if this compound can't do the same membrane tricks (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cb500086e) as the other polyphenols mentioned yesterday. The chaetochromins seem (http://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01689421) to have (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23606174) a number (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1741-4520.1987.tb00707.x/abstract) of biological effects, which could be through all sorts of mechanisms. There's nothing to say that some of them aren't due to direct ligand-binding interactions (such as the one proposed in this latest paper), but I wouldn't rule out membrane perturbations, either. And I wouldn't bet on 4058-G05 becoming a drug, although it might lead to one eventually, after a lot of hard work.
