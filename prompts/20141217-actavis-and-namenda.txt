Actavis and Namenda
17 Dec 2014

John LaMattina has a column (http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnlamattina/2014/12/17/actavis-stance-on-namenda-is-harming-pharmas-image/) at Forbes about the situation with Actavis and their Alzheimer's drug, Namenda (memantine). That situation is not a pretty one: the company has an extended-release form of the drug coming on, which they believe will be more convenient to dose. And that's fine - except that part of their strategy is to discontinue the original dosage form. 
 This is a larger-scale version of the sort of thing that I banged on Retrophin about (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/09/11/the_most_unconscionable_drug_price_hike_i_have_yet_seen) earlier this year. Dropping useful drugs just so that your new formulation can rule the world seems to be a particularly nasty form of portfolio management, and LaMattina is absolutely right when he says that: 
 Discontinuation of Namenda in order to boost sales of the XR version reinforces all of the bad views that people have of the pharmaceutical industry and provides great fodder for its critics. Actavis has joined the “Big Pharma” club. It would be nice if it became part of the solution to Big Pharma’s image woes, rather than adding to the problem. 
 Right now, the whole issue is in court, thanks to an injunction that prevents the company from following through on this strategy. Actavis has appealed, and a hearing took place earlier this week ( more on this at Pharmalot (http://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2014/12/15/the-end-of-the-hard-switch-what-the-judge-says-about-an-actavis-tactic/) ). I would not mind seeing this tactic vanish from the earth, and if it takes the law to make it happen, then that's what we get. We'll get worse if this sort of thing continues.
