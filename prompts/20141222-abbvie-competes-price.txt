AbbVie Competes on Price
22 Dec 2014

Well, folks, if you wonder where the price-cutting competition is in the drug industry, it's here. AbbVie is competing with Gilead in the (very lucrative) hepatitis C market, and since Gilead had already staked out a big position, AbbVie is undercutting them in the health insurance market (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/abbvies-blockbuster-hep-c-approval-puts-it-toe-toe-gilead/2014-12-19) . 
 Late last night, Express Scripts, a big prescription management company, announced that they were making AbbVie's cocktail their exclusive therapy for Hep C. This was done in return for substantial discounting, but it's not going to be without trade-offs: 
 While AbbVie’s drug has proven effective in trials, it requires more pills than Gilead’s drug and sometimes must be taken with another medication with unpleasant side effects. That means the Express Scripts deal is likely to stir controversy about whether the company’s push to rein in rising drug prices is also limiting patients’ treatment options. 
 So here we are, in the long-awaited era where billion-dollar therapies duke it out head-to-head. Adam Feuerstein is already out with a piece (http://www.thestreet.com/story/12992524/1/express-scripts-and-abbvie-drug-pricing-deal-might-devastate-biotech-bull-market.html) saying that this deal might rattle the biotech bull market: 
 After today, investors are no longer going to ask biotech executives, "What will you charge for your new drug?" Instead, the new question becomes: "What will Express Scripts -- or any other pharmacy benefit manager --- allow you to charge for your new drug?" 
 Let's see how we like it. Pricing power is not infinite, and never was, but some people are going to have to get used to that. 
 Update: as per the comments section, Feuerstein has updated his post (linked above) with comments from some investors who feel that the short-term nature of Hep C treatment makes this sort of deal more possible than it would be in some other areas (oncology, for example).
