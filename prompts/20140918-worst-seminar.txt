The Worst Seminar
18 Sep 2014

Thinking of good seminars and bad ones reminds me of a story, which I'm surprised that I haven't told here, because it's a favorite memory of mine from grad school. Like everyone else, I've attended some pretty deadly talks over the years - some of them had decent subject matter, but were presented murderously, while others had such grim content that they would not have been redeemed by substituting the best speaker available. Combine those two, and you have a section of the Venn diagram that makes you wonder what you've done with your life (or with a previous one) to be sitting through the thing. 
 I remember coming back upstairs after one of those. Like most grad students, I didn't have the nerve to just bail on a speaker if they turned out to be horrible (heck, I sometimes don't have the nerve now). So I'd sat through a real forced march, or forced stagger, though a bunch of uninteresting stuff delivered at dictation speed in a nasal monotone. At this remove, I couldn't tell you what it was about even for a large reward; all I remember was the pointlessness. 
 So I was back in front of my hood when my labmate at the time appeared in the doorway. "That was the WORST seminar I have EVER heard in my LIFE!" he proclaimed, and I could only agree with him, which I did with a strange expression on my face. "Why are you grinning like that?" he asked. "Because the seminar speaker just walked behind you when you said that", I told him (truthfully). "No!" he said in horror, and looked off to his right down the hall. "Oh my God! Oh, well. He's heard it before." And maybe he had. Nominations for your own worst seminar experience are welcome in the comments, if you haven't blocked them out of your mind by now. 
 By the way, I checked to see if I'd told this story on the site by a Google trick, which is useful for searching the site as a whole. Just start your query with site:pipeline.corante.com, and you'll search only within that domain. It works quite well, but to be sure, I went and checked a text backup of the site (I make one from time to time, via an "Export" command. In case you're wondering, the whole site (posts and comments) rendered in 10-point Courier with standard margins on letter-sized paper, now comes to over 28,000 pages. Dang. I did a search for "worst seminar" and didn't find the phrase, but at this point you'd have to do a search for "Swann" to find the text of "Rememberance of Things Past" in there.
