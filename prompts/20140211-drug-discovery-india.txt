Drug Discovery in India
11 Feb 2014

Molecular biologist Swapnika Ramu, a reader from India, sends along a worthwhile (and tough) question. She says that after her PhD (done in the US), her return to India has made her "less than optimistic" about the current state of drug discovery there. (Links in the below quote have been added by me, not her: 
 Firstly, there isn't much by way of new drug development in India. Secondly, as you have discussed many times on your blog. . .drug pricing in India remains highly contentious, especially with the recent (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/03/13/nexavar_licensed_by_force_in_india) patent disputes (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/04/01/novartis_loses_the_glivec_patent_fight_in_india) . Much of the public discourse descends into anti-big pharma rhetoric, and there is little to no reasoned debate about how such issues should be resolved. . . 
 I would like to hear your opinion on what model of drug discovery you think a developing nation like India should adopt, given the constraints of finance and a limited talent pool. Target-based drug discovery was the approach that my previous company adopted, and not surprisingly this turned out to be a very expensive strategy that ultimately offered very limited success. Clearly, India cannot keep depending upon Western pharma companies to do all the heavy lifting when it comes to developing new drugs, simply to produce generic versions for the Indian public. The fact that several patents are being challenged in Indian courts would make pharma skittish about the Indian market, which is even more of a concern if we do not have a strong drug discovery ecosystem of our own. Since there isn't a robust VC-based funding mechanism (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/03/08/biopharma_startups_in_india_and_china_do_they_exist) , what do you think would be a good approach to spurring innovative drug discovery in the Indian context (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2010/05/26/indias_research_culture) ? 
 Well, that is a hard one. My own opinion is that India only has a limited talent pool as compared to Western Europe or the US - the country still has a lot more trained chemists and biologists than most other places. It's true, though, that the numbers don't tell the story very well. The best people from India are very, very good, but there are (from what I can see) a lot of poorly trained ones with degrees that seem (at least to me) worth very little (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/01/02/it_just_so_happens_that_i_have_a_conference_right_here) . Still, you've still got a really substantial number of real scientists, and I've no doubt that India could have several discovery-driven drug companies if the financing were easier to come by (and the IP situation a bit less murky - those two factors are surely related). Whether it would have those, or even should , is another question. 
 As has been clear for a while, the Big Pharma model has its problems. Several players are in danger of falling out of the ranks (Lilly, AstraZeneca), and I don't really see anyone rising up to replace them. The companies that have grown to that size in the last thirty years mostly seem to be biotech-driven (Amgen, Biogen, Genentech as was, etc.) 
 So is that the answer? Should Indian companies try to work more in that direction than in small molecule drugs? Problem is, the barriers to entry in biotech-derived drugs are higher, and that strategy perhaps plays less to the country's traditional strengths in chemistry. But in the same way that even less-developed countries are trying to skip over the landline era of telephones and go straight to wireless, maybe India should try skipping over small molecules. I do hate to write that, but it's not a completely crazy suggestion. 
 But biomolecule or small organic, to get a lot of small companies going in India (and you would need a lot, given the odds) you would need a VC culture, which isn't there yet. The alternative (and it's doubtless a real temptation for some officials) would be for the government to get involved to try to start something, but I would have very low hopes for that, especially given the well-known inefficiencies of the Indian bureaucracy. 
 Overall, I'm not sure if there's a way for most countries not to rely on foreign companies for most (or all) of the new drugs that come along. Honestly, the US is the only country in the world that might be able to get along with only its own home-discovered pharmacopeia, and it would still be a terrible strain to lose the European (and Japanese) discoveries. Even the likes of Japan, Switzerland, and Germany use, for the most part, drugs that were discovered outside their own countries. 
 And in the bigger picture, we might be looking at a good old Adam Smith-style case of comparative advantage (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage) . It sure isn't cheap to discover a new drug in Boston, San Francisco, Basel, etc., but compared to the expense of getting pharma research in Hyderabad up to speed, maybe it's not quite as bad as it looks. In the longer term, I think that India, China, and a few other countries will end up with more totally R&D-driven biomedical research companies of their own, because the opportunities are still coming along, discoveries are still being made, and there are entrepreneurial types who may well feel like taking their chances on them. But it could take a long longer than some people would like, particularly researchers (like Swapnika Ramu) who are there right now. The best hope I can offer is that Indian entrepreneurs should keep their eyes out for technologies and markets that are new enough (and unexplored enough) so that they're competing on a more level playing field. Trying to build your own Pfizer is a bad idea - heck, the people who built Pfizer seem to be experiencing buyer's remorse themselves.
