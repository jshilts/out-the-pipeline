Out to Illinois
3 Mar 2014

I'll be visiting Illinois tomorrow (http://illinois.edu/calendar/detail/852?minCal=201302&cal=20140222skinId%3D3235&eventId=30610584&pos=0) to give a talk as part of the university's Chemistry-Biology Interface program. The first week of March is probably not the time to see the Champaign-Urbana landscape at its best, but then, I'm not leaving a lot of scenic grandeur behind in the Boston area this time of year, either. By March, winter's the guy who hasn't realized that everyone else at the party left a while ago. Fortunately, the snow that was forecast to mess with my flights today seems to have vanished, for once. . .
