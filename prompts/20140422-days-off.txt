Days Off
22 Apr 2014

I'm going to be traveling on Wednesday and Thursday, so blogging will resume again here for Friday morning. This means that something completely insane will no doubt occur in the chemistry/drug discovery world sometime Wednesday afternoon, but it can't be helped. The Pfizer/Disney merger will have to wait until Friday morning for comment from me!
