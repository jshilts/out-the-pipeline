AstraZeneca Survives
27 May 2014

So Pfizer has officially called off their quest to acquire AstraZeneca. I didn't expect things to end like this - up until now, what Pfizer has wanted, Pfizer has gotten (well, except in the clinic). There may well have been other behind-the-scenes overtures that we never heard about being rejected over the years, but this is the first time I can remember someone actually fighting off an open Pfizer attempt. 
 Now comes the hard part. AstraZeneca's management did this by convincing their major shareholders that they'd be better off this way, and now they have to deliver. Delivering, though, is far from straightforward in this business. The worry is that AZ's prospects may have been oversold during the takeover defense, in which case reality may not be welcome when it shows up, as it will. Too many doses of it, and Pfizer may be back in six months, with an even lower bid. Let's hope not. AstraZeneca, over the years, has not always been an ornament of the R&D universe - for some years, they spent more money for fewer returns than anyone else. But they still didn't deserve what was in line to happen to them if the Pfizer deal went through. 
 Pfizer, for its part, still has the same tax problems it had before, and will presumably still be looking for ways to solve them. Getting results in the accounting department is still a lot easier than getting results in the lab, so I'd be surprised if the company doesn't come up with something else in that line.
