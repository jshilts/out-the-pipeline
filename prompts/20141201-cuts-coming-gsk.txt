Cuts Coming at GSK
1 Dec 2014

Let's get this one out on the table: GSK is going to announce some big cuts on Wednesday. I've been hearing about this for some time, from various sources, but saw no point in writing about it that early. The company itself announced back in October that it had a new cost-cutting scheme on the way, but gave no details. But I note that Reuters has picked up the story (http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/30/us-gsk-usa-cuts-idUSKCN0JE0BL20141130?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews&rpc=71&google_editors_picks=true) , citing "sources familiar with the matter". So I'll cite some of those, too. 
 From what I'm hearing, the reorg is going to be worldwide, but very US-centric. And inside the US, the RTP site is likely to feel it harder than Philadelphia does. I hear different reports on that, but I don't like the sound of any of them. I hate to start out the week on this note, but I know that the GSK folks have been expecting bad news for some time now. Let's get it over with, and see what happens then.
