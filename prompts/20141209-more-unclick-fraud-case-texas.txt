Back to the Bielawski lab's "unclick" trouble. Back in June, Science had published (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/06/27/varieties_of_scientific_deception) an "Expression of Concern" about the group's original paper. Two (http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4py90087a) more journal articles (http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4sc90048k) have had similar notes added to them since then. And now C&E Newsreports (http://cen.acs.org/articles/92/web/2014/12/Texas-Student-Admits-Falsifying-Data.html) C&E News that UT-Austin has concluded an investigation into the problem and has stated that a common author of all three papers has confessed to fabricating data. 
 As the article notes, there's only one common author other than Bielawski himself, so that sort of narrows things down. And that author (Kelly Wiggins) appears on several other papers from the group, which are now being re-examined in turn. Her whereabouts seem to be unknown, after leaving a postdoctoral position at Illinois. Bielawski himself is no longer at UT either, having taken a position at an institute in South Korea (on the face of it, an unusual choice). Nothing good has come out of this, as far as I can see, and nothing looks likely to, either.
