Genius, Sheer Genius

So we have bogus scientific journals out there, and we have people who will sell you results so you can make just-add-water papers for the real journals. And we have impact factors, the overuse of which leads to still more bogosity in every part of scientific publishing. So. . . why not sellfake impact factors (http://scholarlyoa.com/2014/02/11/bogus-new-impact-factor-appears/) fake impact factors ? That way, you can harvest publication fees from credulous impact-seeking bozos. My Iranian wife tells me that there's a saying in Farsi that translates as "A thief robs a thief, and God smiles".
