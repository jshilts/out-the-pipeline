Merrimack Wins One
1 May 2014

You don't get the chance to say "positive Phase III results in advanced pancreatic cancer" very often, but it looks like Merrimack Pharmaceuticals is able to today (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/merrimack-heads-fda-after-scoring-positive-phiii-pancreatic-cancer/2014-05-01) . The company has had some real highs and lows over the last few years, but they've made the money hold out long enough to see this. In combination with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin (but not as a stand-alone), the company MM-398 showed a real increase in survival. 
 As you might expect, that increase can be looked at more than one way. The standard-of-care group made it for about four months, and the treatment group for about six. You can say "just two months more" or "fifty per cent improvement", as you wish. I hope that I never have to think about advanced pancreatic cancer survival figures in detail, is all I can say. It's worth noting that MM-398 is not some new compound or new mechanism - it's a new way to dose the well-known drug irinotecan (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irinotecan) , which is already part of the standard regiment for the disease. The company has made a liposomal formulation, and that data would indicate that this really does make a difference. Congratulations to them - that's a very, very tough patient population to see anything happen in.
