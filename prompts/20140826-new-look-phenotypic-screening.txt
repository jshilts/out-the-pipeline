A New Look at Phenotypic Screening
26 Aug 2014

There have been several analyses (http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v15/n13/full/nbt1297-1318.html) that have suggested (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2011/07/07/phenotypic_screening_for_the_win) that phenotypic drug discovery was unusually effective (http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v10/n7/full/nrd3480.html) in delivering "first in class" drugs. Now comes a reworking (http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v13/n8/abs/nrd4336.html) of that question, and these authors (Jörg Eder, Richard Sedrani, and Christian Wiesmann of Novartis) find plenty of room to question that conclusion. 
 What they've done is to deliberately focus on the first-in-class drug approvals from 1999 to 2013, and take a detailed look at their origins. There have been 113 such drugs, and they find that 78 of them (45 small molecules and 33 biologics) come from target-based approaches, and 35 from "systems-based" approaches. They further divide the latter into "chemocentric" discovery, based around known pharmacophores, and so on, versus pure from-the-ground-up phenotypic screening, and the 33 systems compounds then split out 25 to 8. 
 As you might expect, a lot of these conclusions depend on what you classify as "phenotypic". The earlier paper stopped at the target-based/not target-based distinction, but this one is more strict: phenotypic screening is the evaluation of a large number of compounds (likely a random assortment) against a biological system, where you look for a desired phenotype without knowing what the target might be. And that's why this paper comes up with the term "chemocentric drug discovery", to encompass isolation of natural products, modification of known active structures, and so on. 
 Such conclusions also depend on knowing what approach was used in the original screening, and as everyone who's written about these things admits, this isn't always public information. The many readers of this site who've seen a drug project go from start to finish will appreciate how hard it is to find an accurate retelling of any given effort. Stuff gets left out, forgotten, is un- (or over-)appreciated, swept under the rug, etc. (And besides, an absolutely faithful retelling, with every single wrong turn left in, would be pretty difficult to sit through, wouldn't it?) At any rate, by the time a drug reaches FDA approval, many of the people who were present at the project's birth have probably scattered to other organizations entirely, have retired or been retired against their will, and so on. 
 But against all these obstacles, the authors seem to have done as thorough a job as anyone could possibly do. So looking further at their numbers, here are some more detailed breakdowns. Of those 45 first-in-class small molecules, 21 were from screening (18 of those high-throughput screening, 1 fragment-based, 1 in silico , and one low-throughput/directed screening). 18 came from chemocentric approaches, and 6 from modeling off of a known compound. 
 Of the 33 systems-based drugs, those 8 that were "pure phenotypic" feature one antibody (alemtuzumab) which was raised without knowledge of its target, and seven small molecules: sirolimus, fingolimod, eribulin, daptomycin, artemether–lumefantrine, bedaquiline and trametinib. The first three of those are natural products, or derived from natural products. Outside of fingolimod, all of them are anti-infectives or antiproliferatives, which I'd bet reflects the comparative ease of running pure phenotypic assays with those readouts. 
 Here are the authors on the discrepancies between their paper and the earlier one: 
 At first glance, the results of our analysis appear to sig­nificantly deviate from the numbers previously pub­lished for first­-in­-class drugs, which reported that of the 75 first-­in-­class drugs discovered between 1999 and 2008, 28 (37%) were discovered through phenotypic screening, 17 (23%) through target-­based approaches, 25 (33%) were biologics and five (7%) came from other approaches. This discrepancy occurs for two reasons. First, we consider biologics to be target­-based drugs, as there is little philosophical distinction in the hypothesis­ driven approach to drug discovery for small­-molecule drugs versus biologics. Second, the past 5 years of our analysis time frame have seen a significant increase in the approval of first-­in-­class drugs, most of which were discovered in a target­-based fashion. 
 Fair enough, and it may well be that many of us have been too optimistic about the evidence for the straight phenotypic approach. But the figure we don't have (and aren't going to get) is the overall success rate for both techniques. The number of target-based and phenotypic-based screening efforts that have been quietly abandoned - that's what we'd need to have to know which one has the better delivery percentage. If 78/113 drugs, 69% of the first-in-class approvals from the last 25 years, have come from target-based approaches how does that compare with the total number of first-in-class drug projects? My own suspicion is that target-based drug discovery has accounted for more than 70% of the industry's efforts over that span, which would mean that systems-based approaches have been relatively over-performing. But there's no way to know this for sure, and I may just be coming up with something that I want to hear. 
 That might especially be true when you consider that there are many therapeutic areas where phenotypic screening basically impossible (Alzheimer's, anyone?) But there's a flip side to that argument: it means that there's no special phenotypic sauce that you can spread around, either. The fact that so many of those pure-phenotypic drugs are in areas with such clear cellular readouts is suggestive. Even if phenotypic screeningwere to have some statistical advantage, you can't just go around telling people to be "more phenotypic" and expect increased success, especially outside anti-infectives or antiproliferatives. 
 The authors have another interesting point to make. As part of their analysis of these 113 first-in-class drugs, they've tried to see what the timeline is from the first efforts in the area to an approved drug. That's not easy, and there are some arbitrary decisions to be made. One example they give is anti-angiogenesis. The first report of tumors being able to stimulate blood vessel growth was in 1945. The presence of soluble tumor-derived growth factors was confirmed in 1968. VEGF, the outstanding example of these, was purified in 1983, and was cloned in 1989. So when did the starting pistol fire for drug discovery in this area? The authors choose 1983, which seems reasonable, but it's a judgment call. 
 So with all that in mind, they find that the average lead time (from discovery to drug) for a target-based project is 20 years, and for a systems-based drug it's been 25 years. They suggest that since target-based drug discovery has only been around since the late 1980s or so, that its impact is only recently beginning to show up in the figures, and that it's in much better shape than some would suppose. 
 The data also suggest that target-­based drug discovery might have helped reduce the median time for drug discovery and development. Closer examination of the differences in median times between systems­-based approaches and target­-based approaches revealed that the 5-­year median difference in overall approval time is largely due to statistically significant differences in the period from patent publication to FDA approval, where target-­based approaches (taking 8 years) took only half the time as systems­-based approaches (taking 16 years). . . 
 The pharmaceutical industry has often been criticized for not being sufficiently innovative. We think that our analysis indicates otherwise and perhaps even suggests that the best is yet to come as, owing to the length of time between project initiation and launch, new technologies such as high­-throughput screening and the sequencing of the human genome may only be starting to have a major impact on drug approvals. . . 
 Now that's an optimistic point of view, I have to say. The genome certainly still has plenty of time to deliver, but you probably won't find too many other people saying in 2014 that HTS is only now starting to have an impact on drug approvals. My own take on this is that they're covering too wide a band of technologies with such statements, lumping together things that have come in at different times during this period and which would be expected to have differently-timed impacts on the rate of drug discovery. On the other hand, I would like this glass-half-full view to be correct, since it implies that things should be steadily improving in the business, and we could use it. 
 But the authors take pains to show, in the last part of their paper, that they're not putting down phenotypic drug discovery. In fact, they're calling for it to be strengthened as its own discipline, and not (as they put it) just as a falling back to the older "chemocentric" methods of the 1980s and before: 
 Perhaps we are in a phase today similar to the one in the mid­-1980s, when systems-­based chemocentric drug discovery was largely replaced by target­-based approaches. This allowed the field to greatly expand beyond the relatively limited number of scaffolds that had been studied for decades and to gain access to many more pharmacologically active compound classes, pro­viding a boost to innovation. Now, with an increased chemical space, the time might be right to further broaden the target space and open up new avenues. This could well be achieved by investing in phenotypic screening using the compound libraries that have been established in the context of target-­based approaches. We therefore consider phenotypic screening not as a neoclassical approach that reverts to a supposedly more successful systems­-based method of the past, but instead as a logical evolution of the current target­-based activi­ties in drug discovery. Moreover, phenotypic screening is not just dependent on the use of many tools that have been established for target-­based approaches; it also requires further technological advancements. 
 That seems to me to be right on target: we probably are in a period just like the mid-to-late 1980s. In that case, though, a promising new technology was taking over because it seemed to offer so much more. Today, it's more driven by disillusionment with the current methods - but that means, even more, that we have to dig in and come up with some new ones and make them work.
