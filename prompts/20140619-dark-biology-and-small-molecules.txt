Dark Biology And Small Molecules
19 Jun 2014

Here's a discussion I got into the other day, in which I expressed some forceful opinions. I wanted to run it past a wider audience to see if I'm grounded in reality, or out on my own island (which has happened before). 
 Without getting into any details, we were talking about an area of potential drug research that has to do with transcriptional regulation. This one is clearly complicated - what part of transcription isn't complicated? But it's known that you can get things to happen by using things like epigenetic tool compounds (bromodomains, HDAC inhibitors, methyltransferases), and nuclear receptor ligands. None of these give you everything you want to see, by any means, but you do see some effect. 
 My take on this was that an effort to follow up with more epigenetic compounds and nuclear receptor ligands might well be a case of the classic "looking under the lamp-post because that's where the light is" syndrome. We don't have many small-molecule handles for affecting transcription, went my reasoning, and although such things are bromodomains, HDAC inhibition, and nuclear receptor signaling are wide-ranging, there's a lot more than the compounds in these spaces surely don't cover. In fact, given the wide range of these mechanisms, seeing a little tickling of any given transcriptional mechanism is about what I would expect from almost any of them, applied to almost anything. But that, to my mind, didn't necessarily mean that it was a lead worth following up. 
 My recommendation was for a phenotypic screen, if a good one could be worked up. There must be plenty of stuff going on with this system that we don't have any idea about, went my thinking. In the same way that the matter we can see through a telescope is only a tiny fraction of what appears to be really out there in the universe, I think that there's a vast amount of "dark biology" that we don't know much of. And the overwhelming majority of it has to be considered dark if we only consider the parts that we can light up with small molecules. For something that has to involve a huge array of protein-protein interactions, protein-nucleic acid interactions, and who knows what ancillary enzymes and binding sites, I wondered, what are the odds that the things that we happen know how to do with small molecules are the real answer? 
 So if you're going to dive into such waters (and many of you out there might be swimming around in them right now), by all means test whatever epigenetic and nuclear receptor compounds you might have around. Maybe you'll get a strong response. But if it all comes back as a little bit of this and a tiny bit of that, I'd say that these are unlikely to be convertible into robust drug mechanisms - the odds are that if there even is a robust drug mechanism out there, that you haven't hit it yet and that it will announce itself a bit more clearly if you manage to. A well-designed phenotypic screen might well be the best way to find such things, always keeping in mind that a badly designed phenotypic screen is the tar pit itself, the worst of both worlds. 
 So, am I too gloomy? Too jaded? Or simply a well-meaning realist? Thoughts welcome.
