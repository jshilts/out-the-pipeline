Cancer Immunotherapy's Growing Pains
7 Apr 2014

Cancer immunotherapy, which I've written about several times here (and which has claimed the constant attention of biopharma investors for some time now) has run into an inevitable difficulty: its patients are very sick, and its effects are very strong. Sloan-Kettering announced over the weekend (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/memorial-sloan-kettering-hits-brakes-engineered-t-cell-cancer-study/2014-04-06) that it's having to halt recruitment in a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell trial against non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: 
 Six patients died of either disease relapse or progression, said MSK, while two patients died in remission from complications related to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. An additional two patients died within two weeks of receiving a CAR-T cell infusion. 
 "The first of these two patients had a prior history of cardiac disease and the second patient died due to complications related to persistent seizure activity," noted MSK's presentation. "As a matter of routine review of adverse events on study, our center made a decision to pause enrollment and review these two patients in detail." 
 This study is associated with Juno Therapeutics, and the company says that it expects to continue once the review is finished. There's a huge amount of activity in this area, with Juno as one of the main players, and Novartis (who are working with the team at Penn) as another. Unfortunately, that activity is both legal and scientific; the patent situation in this area has yet to be clarified. This is an extremely promising approach, but it has a long way to go.
