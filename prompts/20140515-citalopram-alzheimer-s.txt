Citalopram for Alzheimer's?
15 May 2014

Here's a surprise - the well-known antidepressant citalopram (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citalopram) appears to decrease (http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/6/236/236re4) formation of beta-amyloid (press release here (http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-05/uops-cah051314.php) ). There have been (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15955598) some connections reported between serotonin signaling and amyloid production, but this makes it rather explicit. The paper not only reports rodent data, but shows human levels of beta-amyloid were decreased by nearly 40% in the CSF relative to controls. 
 This would make a person think that a preventative/early patient trial of the drug to see if it slows the progression of Alzheimer's has to be coming up very shortly. As an approved medication, the barriers are low, and the rewards are high. It could end up being one of the better whacks at the amyloid hypothesis in general. We need all the reads on that one that we can get, so these results good news from a scientific standpoint, no matter what the medical effects.
