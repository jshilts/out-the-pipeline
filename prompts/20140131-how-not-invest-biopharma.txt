Did these people really take their life's savings and load them into a tiny biotech stock on the basis of a rumor? That's what these Provectus investors say, and they're writing to blame (http://www.thestreet.com/story/12286892/2/biotech-stock-mailbag-cell-therapeutics-and-the-ariad-hostile-react-o-meter-meltdown.html) Adam Feuerstein when things went bad (http://www.thestreet.com/story/12261242/1/the-obsolescence-of-provectus-skin-cancer-drug-means-current-speculative-run-ends-badly.html) . If true, these are the investing equivalent of the "Hey, hold my beer and watch this!" stunts that win Darwin Awards. I can't even imagine.
