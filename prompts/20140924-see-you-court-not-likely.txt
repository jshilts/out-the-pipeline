See You in Court? Not Likely
24 Sep 2014

There had been talk of some sort of trouble brewing via PubPeer (https://pubpeer.com/) , the open-source post-publication review site, and this appears (https://pubpeer.com/topics/1/3F5792FF283A624FB48E773CAAD150#fb14544) to be it. There's more on the issue (http://news.sciencemag.org/people-events/2014/09/anonymous-peer-review-comments-may-spark-legal-battle) at Science : Farzul Sarkar at Wayne State is suing, if he can find the right people to sue. 
 The issue first came to light in August, when PubPeer’s (anonymous) moderators announced that the site had received a “legal threat.” Today, they revealed that the scientist involved is Fazlul Sarkar, a cancer researcher at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan. Sarkar, an author on more than 500 papers and principal investigator for more than $1,227,000 in active grants from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, has, like many scientists, had his work scrutinized on PubPeer. More than 50 papers on which he is an author have received at least one comment from PubPeer users, many of whom point out potential inconsistencies in the papers’ figures, such as perceived similarities between images that are supposed to depict different experiments. 
 Recently, PubPeer was contacted about those comments by Nicholas Roumel, an attorney at Nacht, Roumel, Salvatore, Blanchard & Walker P.C. in Ann Arbor, Michigan, who represents Sarkar and spoke to ScienceInsider on his behalf. On 9 June, the University of Mississippi Medical Center announced that Sarkar would join the faculty in its school of pharmacy. Records from a meeting of the Mississippi Board of Trustees of State Institutions of Higher Learning note that he was offered a tenured position and a salary of $350,000 per year, effective 1 July. 
 But on 19 June, Roumel says, Sarkar got a letter from the University of Mississippi revoking its offer. Science has not seen the letter, but Roumel says that in his view, “it made it crystal clear the PubPeer postings were the reason they were rescinding the job offer.” A representative for the University of Mississippi declined to comment on the case, citing prospective employees’ confidentiality. 
 Yeah, that would put a person in the mood to sue, for sure: tenure, 350K/year, and a chance to leave Detroit. I'm not in a position to say whether Sarkar's been defamed or not, though: there have been many complaints (https://pubpeer.com/search?q=Sarkar) . And I'm also not sure that he's going to get very far trying to find out who the commenters are, because the folks at PubPeer may well have no idea themselves. (I generally have no idea who the people leaving comments on this site might be!) Under US law (the Communications Decency Act of 1996, it's pretty hard (http://www.rcfp.org/browse-media-law-resources/digital-journalists-legal-guide/immunity-reader-comments-under-section-23) to come after the owners or moderators of a web site for the comments left by its users. So I don't think this is going to get very far, but we shall see.
