Merck Pulls One Out
16 Jan 2014

Merck's vorapaxar (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorapaxar) , a thrombin antagonist that many had thought might never make it (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2011/01/20/mercks_vorapaxar_bleeding_indeed) , has received a positive (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/merck-clears-fda-panel-its-clot-fighting-vorapaxar/2014-01-16) FDA advisory committee vote. I'm glad to see it - peripherally, I go way back (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2008/05/13/in_which_i_hate_a_wonder_drug) with this compound (well, its ancestors), and I really had doubts that Merck could get things to fly. Anticoagulants are a very tricky business - we'll see (if and when it does get approved) what sort of market it can carve out. They're up for treating patient who have already had one cardiac event, which is still a good-sized market.
