More From The Bottom of the Publishing Barrel
20 Nov 2014

Now, if you want to get a paper published in a prestigious journal like The International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology , you'd better make sure that you're up to it. You'd better make sure that you have good stuff to report, and that the paper is worth a spot in a venue like that. Most of all, you'd better make sure to send $150 to some guy named Tej Pal Singh. 
 That's how this paper made it through (http://scholarlyoa.com/2014/11/20/bogus-journal-accepts-profanity-laced-anti-spam-paper/) . It's from a ticked-off Australian engineer, and he gave it the arresting title of "Get Me Off Your F*#&ing Mailing List". That, by coincidence, is also the text of the abstract. And of the entire paper, over and over and over, just without those internal punctuation marks. 
 Accepted, with "minor revisions". Rated as "Excellent" by the "reviewer". Ready to publish. All that stands in the way are those hundred and fifty bucks, and somehow I think that Tej is going to have a bit of a wait.
