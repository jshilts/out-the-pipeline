Remember Vytorin? The Data Are Finally Coming.
13 Nov 2014

If you follow cardiovascular therapies, you'll no doubt have seen that a bit of information has come out on Merck's long, long, long-running IMPROVE-IT trial. That is the massive outcomes study for Vytorin, the combination of ezetimibe (the Schering-Plough cholesterol absorption inhibitor) and simvastatin (Merck's early statin drug). This combo ran into serious controversy back in 2008 (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2008/04/01/vytorin_its_a_pity) , when some clinical studies suggested that it had far less benefit than it should in some patients. The way that clinical data got released was not very glorious (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/02/15/merck_finally_settles_over_vytorin) , either, and brought suspicions that the companies had tried to bury it. The only way to be sure was to run a big long-term study on cardiovascular outcomes. Such a trial was already underway even back in 2008, and here we are in 2014 without the numbers. 
 Over the years there have been various doubts and fears about what was going on. Early last year, there were reports (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/02/05/not_working_out_so_well_at_merck) that Merck was having to work over the data again, and that doesn't inspire confidence. But the Wall Street Journal noticed the other day that a Merck SEC filing mentioned that it had determined that the trial's results would not result in any accounting changes to the value the company had assigned to Vytorin. 
 Ed Silverman wonders at Pharmalot (http://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2014/11/11/does-a-positive-result-for-the-vytorin-trial-really-help-merck/) if it really matters at this point. The results could be very scientifically interesting, because there's a lot that we're not grasping about lipoproteins and their relation to disease. But both the ezetimibe combo (Vytorin) and ezetimibe itself (Zetia) are facing generic competition in perhaps 18 months (if the generic companies stay interested) - this is all coming too late in the life cycle to affect anything for Merck. It looks like we'll see the actual number later this month. 
 Update: Matthew Herper says that this could have a big effect (http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2014/11/13/a-day-of-reckoning-approaches-for-merck-and-its-critics/) on the use of surrogate markers in clinical trials. But that will happen only if, as he says, the most likely outcome doesn't happen. That outcome? "We Get Mud" - messy, hard-to-interpret data, with no strong signals to act on. 
 Second update: the data are out (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-17/merck-s-vytorin-first-cholesterol-drug-to-further-cut-heart-risk.html) . The combination appears to be effective.
