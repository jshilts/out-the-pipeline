Merck KgaA Buys Sigma-Aldrich
22 Sep 2014

Well, I didn't see this one coming: Merck KGaA (Merck-Darmstadt) is buying Sigma-Aldrich (http://www.businessinsider.com/merck-to-acquire-sigma-aldrich-2014-9) . So that's Merck/Millipore/Sigma-Aldrich, which will be a big life sciences company indeed. It's a $17 billion dollar deal, which goes off at at 37% premium to SIAL's close on Friday. Doesn't look much like any news of this offer leaked out, either, since the company's stock went down on Friday, and I don't see anything particularly weird in the options activity, either. 
 Merck KGaA has had a rough time of it recently trying to be a biotech company - perhaps they've decided that there's more stability in services?
