The Most Common Heterocycles in Drugs
9 Oct 2014

What sorts of heterocycles show up the most in approved drugs? This question has been asked several times before in the literature, but it's always nice to see an update (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm501100b) . This one is from the Njardson group at Arizona, producers of the "Top 200 Drugs" posters (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2011/02/10/the_top_200_drugs) . 
 84% of all unique small-molecule drugs approved by the FDA have at least one nitrogen atom in them, and 59% have some sort of nitrogen heterocycle. Leaving out the cephems and penems, which are sort of a special case and not really general-purpose structures, the most popular ones are piperidine, pyridine, pyrrolidine, thiazole, imidazole, indole, and tetrazole, in that order. Some other interesting bits: 
 All the four-membered nitrogen heterocycles are beta-lactams; no azetidine-containing structure has yet made it to approval. 
 The thiazoles rank so highly because so many of them are in the beta-lactam antibiotics as well. Every single approved thiazole is substituted in the 2 position, and no monosubstituted thiazole has ever made it into the pharmacopeia, either. 
 Almost all the indole-containing drugs are substituted at C3 and/or C5 - pindolol (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pindolol) is an outlier. 
 The tetrazoles are all either antibiotics or cardiovascular drugs (the sartans). 
 92% of all pyrrolidine-substructure compounds have a substituent on the nitrogen. 
 Morpholine looks more appealing as a heterocycle than it really is - piperidine and piperazine both are found far more frequently. And I'll bet that many of those morpholines are just there for solubility, and that otherwise a piperidine would have served for SAR purposes. Ethers don't always seem to do that much for you. 
 Piperidines rule. There's a huge variety of them out there, the great majority substituted on the nitrogen. Azepanes, though, one methylene larger, have only three representatives. 
 83% of piperazine-containing drugs are substituted at both nitrogens. 
 There are a lot of other interesting bits in the paper, which goes on to examine fused and bicyclic heterocycles. But I think this afternoon I'll go make some piperidines and increase my chances.
