Green Coffee Beans Will Mostly Slim Your Wallet
22 Oct 2014

Very few readers of this site are likely to have a good opinion of Dr. Oz (I certainly don't (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/01/29/dr_ozs_problem) ). And very few readers will be surprised to hear that one of his highly-touted miracle weight loss regiments - green coffee bean extract (GCA) - has turned out to be a load of faked-up nonsense. Retraction Watchhas the details (http://retractionwatch.com/2014/10/20/authors-retract-green-coffee-bean-diet-paper-touted-by-dr-oz/) Retraction Watch , and let's just say that the clinical trial results were. . .a little bit below the desired standard: 
 The FTC charges that the study’s lead investigator repeatedly altered the weights and other key measurements of the subjects, changed the length of the trial, and misstated which subjects were taking the placebo or GCA during the trial. When the lead investigator was unable to get the study published, the FTC says that AFS hired researchers Joe Vinson and Bryan Burnham at the University of Scranton to rewrite it. Despite receiving conflicting data, Vinson, Burnham, and AFS never verified the authenticity of the information used in the study, according to the complaint. 
 Other than that, the study was just fine, I guess. Sheesh. I have to admit, that's even worse than I had pictured, and that's saying a lot. Dr. Oz himself, though, will probably not even note this in passing. Too many other miracle cures to peddle, too many TV slots to fill. He's a busy man, you know. 
 Update: the show has released a rather bland statement about this whole affair, but has also apparently scrubbed the web site (http://retractionwatch.com/2014/10/23/dr-oz-following-green-coffee-bean-diet-retraction-site-scrubbed-further-study-is-needed/) of any mention of green coffee beans, had videos taken down at YouTube, and so on. So that's all right, then!
