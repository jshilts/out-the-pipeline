Reversal of Type II Diabetes May Be Possible
17 Jul 2014

Here's some big news (http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature13540.html) : Ron Evans and co-workers at Salk report that treatment with the growth factor FGF1 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FGF1) appears to reverse type II diabetes in mice. (Article in Science Daily on this study here (http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/07/140716131541.htm) ). Evans has been working in this field (diabetes, insulin sensitivity, and related areas like growth factors and nuclear receptors) for a long time, and I would definitely take this work seriously. 
 They reported a couple of years ago (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3358516/) that FGF1 seemed to be involved in insulin sensitivity. It's induced in adipose tissue under high-fat diet conditions. FGF1 knockout mice, for their part, have a seemingly normal phenotype, but when they're put on high-fat diets they respond very poorly indeed, quickly showing abnormal glucose control and other defects. 
 This new paper shows that in normal mice with metabolic problems brought on by a high-fat diet, a single injection of recombinant FGF1 is sufficient to normalize glucose for up to 48 hours. Interestingly (and importantly), this mechanism doesn't seem to overshoot - you don't swing over to hypoglycemia, which is always a worry in this field. And repeated FGF1 therapy leads to increased insulin sensitivity, suppression of hepatic glucose production - basically, everything you'd want in a Type II diabetes therapy. It's great stuff, and the best candidate I've yet seen for the Real Mechanism behind the disease. 
 Now, FGF1 is a cellular growth factor, so there's a possibility for trouble. But the glucose/insulin effects seem to be mediated by one particular FGF receptor ( FGFR1 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast_growth_factor_receptor_1) ), which makes one hopeful that this axis can be separated out. I would expect to see a great deal of work coming on variants of the protein with longer plasma half-life and greater selectivity. In vivo, the protein seems to be secreted and used locally in specific tissues - it's not in wide circulation. But perhaps it should be - you can be sure that someone's going to try to find out. Overall, this is excellent, exciting news, and we're poised to learn a huge amount about type II diabetes and how to treat it.
