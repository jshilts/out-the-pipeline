Bind's Attempts To Remake Chemotherapy
20 Nov 2014

There's a lot of effort (and a lot of money) going into targeted nanoparticle drug delivery. And that's completely understandable, because the way we dose things now, with any luck, will eventually come to seem primitive. So you used to just have people eat the compound, did you, or just poke it into their bloodstream with a sharp stick, and let it float around wherever it would and hope that it made it to the target without doing too much else? Quaint. 
 The nanoparticle idea, on the other hand, is to encapsulate the drug somehow in the layers of these tiny particles which will release it only under the right conditions. The outermost layers, meanwhile, are meant to be coated in ways (recognition peptides, usually) that send the payload to only the right cell types. Imagine a drug for lung cancer where all of the dose goes to the lungs, and all of it hits only the cancerous cells. You could put in the roughest, toughest chemotherapy agents available, because you wouldn't be stuck with poisoning the rest of the patient's body at a slightly slower rate than the cancer, which is how it works too much of the time now. 
 But that level of control is yet to come. We just got another read on this (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/bind-heralds-hope-its-nanotech-cancer-drug-phase-ii-study/2014-11-19) in the clinical results from Bind Therapeutics (http://bindtherapeutics.com/) , one of the leading companies in this field. Bind is another Bob Langer-derived company - when other parts of the US (or other countries) talk about wanting to have humming biotech hubs of their own, they'd be happy just to have Bob Langer. Bind, under CEO Scott Minick, has deals with an impressive list (http://www.bindtherapeutics.com/pipeline/pipeline.html) of big pharma companies to try to apply their nanoparticle delivery systems to existing drugs, although Amgen pulled out of an arrangement with them over the summer. 
 That didn't help the stock, and neither did the latest news. This was a Phase II study in non-small-cell lung cancer patients with docetaxel, a widely used chemotherapy drug that could certainly use some targeted delivery. The results were mixed. Investors were clearly hoping for something better, but it could have been much worse. As that FierceBiotech link above details, the company saw some responders when the new formulation was dosed every three weeks, but not when it was dosed every week, an interesting result that's going to take some thinking about. Inside the every-three-weeks group, the patients with two particular tumor varieties (KRAS or squamous cell carcinoma) seemed to show relatively good responses. But the sample sizes there are small. 
 The company is planning another round of Phase II, concentrating on those subtypes and dropping the once-a-week dose. That's exactly what you do in Phase II: the drug has hit the real world with real patients in it, and you do whatever seems to work. It would have been great if they'd seen a bigger across-the-board response, but these are the early days of targeted nanoparticles. There's a vast amount we don't know about these things; the odds are huge that no one is going to be hitting any balls over any fences for a while yet. Bind's next trial should tell them, though, if their current docetaxel particle idea is worthwhile for NSCLC. 
 That could go either way. The current trial may turn out to have lit up just the sorts of patients who will go on to show impressive benefits, or those effects could just flatten out and slide back into the statistical swamp. Here it is, the absolute essence of drug discovery: there is no way to know in advance. The only way to find out is to round up some more patients, round up some more drug, and round up some more money and try it. Good luck to them!
