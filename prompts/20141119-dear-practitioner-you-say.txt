Dear Practitioner, You Say?
19 Nov 2014

Spam mail is evolving: this afternoon I had one purportedly from the American Medical Association, although it was definitely not sent from their domain. In slightly ungrammatical English (but a cut above many other spammers), it informs me that they're sharing a document with me on Google Docs, and invite me to click a link. That is to say, it's "an important document for you perusal". I can see that the link, though, would direct not to a shared PDF, but to some Java-based thingie (jquery and so on) in Brazil. No thanks. The message makes liberal use of the actual AMA logo and so on, and includes a slightly garbled copyright notice at the end, which is a touch I always appreciate from these sorts of people. 
 I note this mainly because it's the first medical/scientific phishing attack I've had. I mean, I get plenty of spam, and more invitations to speak at huge-sounding Chinese conferences than I can count (Track 17?) But they're after me in a more aboveboard fashion. 
 The lower end of the spam business, I've read, deliberately makes the come-ons so ridiculous to eliminate false positive responses - anyone dumb enough to respond to the exiled widow or corrupt construction minister is probably dumb enough to go all the way, which keeps the senders from wasting valuable scamming time. Phishing attacks, on the other hand, at least the better class of them, go out of their way to seem plausible and clickable. How long will it be before someone starts faking ACS emails? And what will their success rate be?
