Xenon's Use as a Sports Drug Is Banned
20 May 2014

Just a couple of months ago, I wrote about (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/03/21/another_use_for_xenon) how xenon has been used as a performance-enhancing drug. Well, now it's banned (http://www.insidethegames.biz/olympics/winter-olympics/2014/1020159-gas-used-by-russian-sochi-2014-medallists-banned) . But I'd guess that they're going to have to look for its downstream effects, because detecting xenon itself, particularly a good while after exposure, is going to be a tall order. . .
