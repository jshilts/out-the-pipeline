Roche Rebuilds
22 Oct 2014

Roche has announced ambitious plans (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/roche-blueprints-18b-rd-complex-pred/2014-10-22) for new buildings at its home base in Basel: 
 They're building a new home for John Reed and Roche's pRED research group in Basel – and the pharma giant is thinking big. Roche said today that it is committing $1.8 billion to build a new research center in Switzerland which will encompass 4 new office/lab buildings that will house 1,900 R&D staffers. 
 The first step of the process will involve construction of an in vivo center for animal research, slated for completion in 2018. And Roche plans to clear away older buildings to make way for a new office tower as part of a wider building plan that will cost $3.2 billion. 
 I saw the current new Roche office tower when I was in Basel recently - it's hard to miss - and I can't say that it's much of an ornament to the skyline. (People told me that it had originally been planned as more of an architectural statement, but that all that had been scaled back because of the cost, which seemed quite believably Swiss).
