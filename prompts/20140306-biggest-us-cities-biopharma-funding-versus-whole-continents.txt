Biggest US Cities for Biopharma Funding, Versus Whole Continents.
6 Mar 2014

FierceBiotech has their roundup (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/top-15-cities-biotech-venture-funding/2014-03-06) of the top areas of the US for venture capital funding in biopharma in 2013, and naturally, San Francisco and the Boston area are fighting it out for the top spot. But Oakland the the east Bay region are in a separate category, and if those are wrapped into the rest of SF, the whole Bay area wins out by a pretty good margin. 
 But, as was pointed out by Nick Taylor on Twitter (https://twitter.com/NickPaulTaylor) , San Francisco (not even counting Oakland, etc.) and Boston together raised more biopharma VC funding than all of Europe put together .(See slide 10 here (http://images.dowjones.com/company/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2014/01/DJXVS_Europe_Q413_pdf.pdf) ). SF raised $1.15 billion, and Boston $0.93, while all of Europe was about $1.9 billion. 
 And then there's the rest of the Bay area, San Diego, Seattle, NY/NJ/Philadelphia, the Research Triangle and everyone else. In medical research, the US is the startup capital of the world.
