InterMune Bought
25 Aug 2014

It has been a bizarre (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/09/24/when_does_a_biotech_press_release_constitute_fraud) ride for InterMune, its employees (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/02/25/intermune_comes_through) , and its investors (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2010/05/05/intermune_right_back_down_again) . But now it ends with Roche buying them (http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-08-25/roche-to-expand-respiratory-role-with-intermune-puchase) for $8.3 billion dollars, a sum that would have brought incredulous stares a few years ago. The deal makes sense for Roche, and it will provide investors a rationale for years as they buy into small biopharma companies - trying to pick the next InterMune, you know.
