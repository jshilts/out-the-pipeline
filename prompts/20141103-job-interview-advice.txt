Job Interview Advice
3 Nov 2014

I find it very refreshing to be talking again, once in a while, about finding jobs in drug discovery. Via my Twitter feed, I note this fine article (http://cen-online.org/articles/92/i44/Interviewing-Insights.html) from Linda Wang in C&E News about job interviews. It's a very picky world out there in the job market (still not so many jobs, still a lot of good candidates), and this is very useful reading for people on the interview trail. (It appears, for example, that the good ol' put-'em-on-the-spot technique (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2006/01/29/name_reactions_for_one_thousand_alex) is not dead). I've never liked that one, although I don't have much better to offer, either - I've noticed over the years that I'm not very good at predicting how people will be from just an interview. Is anyone? 
 This book, just out, could be another resource: it's called Navigating the Path to Industry (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0990744523/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0990744523&linkCode=as2&tag=lagniappe-20&linkId=ZYP4XPEUA3UTN7VU) , and it's especially aimed at academic scientists (not just entry-level ones, either) who are looking at industrial research positions. That's always seemed like an alternate universe to a lot of people, and this book should fill a gap.
