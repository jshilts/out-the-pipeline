A Last Summer Day Off
29 Aug 2014

I'm going to be taking an extra day of vacation before the kids start back to school, so I'm adding to the Labor Day weekend today. Blogging will resume on Tuesday, unless something gigantic happens before then. If I can come up with something appropriate, maybe I'll put up a recipe!
