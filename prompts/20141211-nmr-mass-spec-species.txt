NMR of a Mass Spec Species
11 Dec 2014

I have to say, I didn't even know that this could be done. This paper (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201410250/abstract) from Angewandte Chemie describes a mass spec/NMR combination analysis that had never occurred to me as possible. The authors (from Ohio U. and Purdue) are looking at a common peptide ion seen in proteomic mass spec studies. And what they do is collect enough of the ions to run an NMR . That just seems bizarre, somehow, because I think that most of us picture the ionic fragments in a mass spec as these ghostly, esoteric things that live only in the outer-space-like vacuum of the instrument (and are present in vanishingly small amounts, at that). The idea of piling them up and running their NMR spectrum seems like someone taking a reflectance IR spectrum of an angel's wing. 
 That's because NMR, for most organic chemists, is a much more home-style, hands-on technique. We take measurable amounts of compounds, stick them into glass tubes, and use pipets to dissolve them up in solvent before taking them over to the NMR instrument. You get your hands on these things - and if you need to, you can go get the tube after it comes back out of the magnet, evaporate the solvent, and get all your sample back. Mass spec, on the other hand, uses ridiculously tiny amounts of material. It's really, really hard as an organic chemist to underload an LC/MS - it seems like you'll always get something, if there's something to get. You take a spec of sample, dissolve it in solvent, and then the machine takes a sip of it that a mosquito wouldn't bother with, because it doesn't need the rest. 
 The structures of these " b ions", as they're known in protein mass spec, has been the subject of a lot of work. Some N-terminal sequences give you oxazolones, some give you diketopiperazines, and others are still undetermined. This study used atmospheric pressure thermal dissociation (APTD), which gets around that vacuum-chamber problem, and they were able to condense material on the inside of the thermal dissociation tube. Bradykinin's b2 ion species was isolated, and NMR showed that it was a trifluoroacetate salt of the diketopiperazine structure. A model peptide, Gly-His-Gly, gave similar results. 
 So how many other mass spec species can this be applied to? And here's a weird thought: could this be a small-scale preparative method for some unusual syntheses? The thermal dissociation method is similar to pyrolysis, but I wonder if there are some sorts of structures that could be made this way that would be difficult to access by other routes. . .
