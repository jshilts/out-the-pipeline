No More Prearranged Editors at PNAS
1 Oct 2014

While we're on the topic of the literature, I see that PNAS has made some changes (http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/09/19/1417688111.short?rss=1) to their system: 
 Although the largest number of submissions to PNAS are through the Direct Submission route, there continues to linger a general perception that to publish a paper in PNAS, an author requires sponsorship of an NAS member. In July 2010, the member Communicated route was eliminated, but to ensure and promote submission of exceptional papers that either were interdisciplinary and hence needed special attention, or were unique and perhaps ahead of their time, authors were able to use the Prearranged Editor (PE) process for Direct Submissions. The PE process was intended to be used on rare occasions but, since we formalized the PE process, more than 11,000 papers have been submitted by authors with a PE designation. Although we are certain that some of these papers truly needed special attention, the vast majority likely did not, and therefore we are discontinuing the PE process as of October 1, 2014. We will continue to honor the current PE submissions. 
 They're setting up a new submission process, which (from what I can see) will make the journal very much like the rest of the field. Are there any odd routes to a PNAS publication left? As for the whole literature landscape, I'm sticking with my characterizations (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/06/20/the_perfect_papers_for_each_journal) and there are plenty more in the comments, for now.
