Google's Nanoparticle Diagnostic Ideas
29 Oct 2014

Google's "Google X" division, the part that works on odd high-risk high-reward projects, is apparently interested (http://www.wired.com/2014/10/google-developing-pill-detect-cancer-diseases/) in diagnostic nanoparticles. That Wired article is pretty short on specifics, but the company's Andrew Conrad revealed a few details in a talk yesterday. The idea, apparently, is to use magnetic-cored nanoparticles to interrogate various body functions, then to reconcentrate them in some superficial vein for a readout. I had thought initially that there would be a blood draw at that point, which seems like less of a leap, but apparently the idea is for some sort of across-the-skin readout. 
 That's still not a crazy idea, although it has a ways to go (and an awful lot of work in animals). And I'm not sure how the noninvasive readout thing is supposed to work - I can imagine a lot more being done if you take some of these things back out. The nanoparticles could be tagged in various ways for sorting after removal, and (in theory) you could get quite a bit of information that way. The tricky part, either way, will be targeting the things that you can't get from just circulating - otherwise you'd just take a blood sample as usual and add your nanoparticle brew to it ex vivo (which is not such a bad idea, either, and has (http://spectrum.ieee.org/nanoclast/biomedical/diagnostics/theranostic-nanoparticle-promises-improved-cancer-treatment-) been worked (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/mp3005885) on by many (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22093226) others). Perhaps that's why Google's team is going the extra step. 
 So they're presumably checking up on solid tissues somewhere, not the soluble blood factors, and that brings up a lot of pharmacokinetic issues. Many things that interact well enough to be diagnostic might well stick to the tissue instead of circulating back around, for example. And the ultimate fate of all these particles will be key - what effects will they have themselves, how well are they cleared, by what routes and at what rate, and so on. But I'll reserve judgment until we know more about this. Google is saying that they're not planning on developing this all the way themselves, but are trying to get other life sciences companies interested. How interested anyone gets might be a measure to watch.
