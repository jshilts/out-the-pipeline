Chemical Myths
18 Nov 2014

Several folks on my Twitter feed have mentioned a new book coming out from Springer, 100 Chemical Myths (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3319084186/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=3319084186&linkCode=as2&tag=lagniappe-20&linkId=FBABCNPLQOESZCCW) . I haven't seen a copy, but it's supposed to "deals with popular yet largely untrue misconceptions and misunderstandings related to chemistry." That gives plenty of room to work in, for sure. 
 Looking over the table of contents on that Amazon link, my guess is that I would agree with the authors pretty much across the board. But my other guess is that the book won't do as much good as anyone would like. I fear that it may be 400 pages of preaching to the choir - the people who need to read it won't ever hear about it, and they probably wouldn't crack the cover on it even if they did. They already have their opinions, firmly held ones, and they already know that this book is full of attempts by some chemists to change their minds, so it'll probably be dismissed out of hand. It could provide useful material for one-on-one encounters, though - I'll report back if I get more details.
