Perhaps Not Quite Technically Legal, Come to Think of It
20 May 2014

Now, wait - you're telling me that just because you're a doctor involved in the clinical trial of a small company's main drug, and you've found out that the trial has been halted by the FDA. . .you're saying that you can't actually unload all your stock (http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-sec-accuses-doctors-in-clinical-trial-of-insider-trading-20140519-story.html) on that information before the public announcement? What, I ask you, is this world coming to? 
 Well, that's what the two physicians in the story must be asking. They maintain that they had no idea that they couldn't do such a thing, that they really didn't know much about this "stock market" stuff, and so on. If that's true, then it's a wonderful example of the havoc that the Dunning-Kruger effect (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) can bring. And considering that they avoided losing $34,000 and $11,000 (real but not life-ruining amounts, you'd figure), maybe they really are that clueless. Or were.
