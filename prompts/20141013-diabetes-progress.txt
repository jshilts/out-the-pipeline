Diabetes Progress
13 Oct 2014

There have recently been some welcome developments in diabetes therapy, both Type I and Type II. For the latter, there's an interesting report (http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nm.3699) of a metabolic uncoupling therapy in Nature Medicine . Weirdly, it uses a known tapeworm medication, niclosamide (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niclosamide) (specifically, the ethanolamine salt). It's toxic to worms by that same mechanism. If you uncouple (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2176586) oxidative phosphorylation and the electron-transport system in the mitochondria (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_phosphorylation) , you end up just chewing up lipids through respiration while not generating any ATP. That's what happens in brown fat (through the action of uncoupling proteins), and that's what used in mammals for generating extra body heat. Many schemes for cranking this up in humans have been looked at over the years, but a full-scale mitochondrial uncoupling drug would be a nasty proposition in humans (see, for example, dinitrophenol (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3550200/) ). DNP will indeed make you lose weight, while at the same time you ravenously try to eat your daily supply of ATP, but this is done at a significant risk of sudden death. (And anything that does a better job than DNP will just skip straight to the "sudden death" part). But niclosamide seems to be less efficacious, which in this case is a good thing. 
 This mechanism diminishes the fat content in liver and muscle tissue, which should improve insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake, and seems to do so very well in mouse models. The authors (Shengkan Jin and colleagues at Rutgers) have formed a company to try to take something in this area into humans. I wish them luck with that - this really could be a good thing for type II and metabolic-syndrome patients, but the idea has proven very difficult over the years. The tox profile is going to be key, naturally, and taking it into the clinic is really the only way to find out if it'll be acceptable. 
 The Type I news is even more dramatic (http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2014/10/giant-leap-against-diabetes/) : a group at Harvard (led by Doug Melton) report inCell (http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(14)01228-8) Cell that they've been able to produce large quantities of glucose-sensitive beta-cells from stem cell precursors. People have been working towards this goal for years, and it hasn't been easy (you can get cells that secrete insulin, but don't sense glucose, for example, but you really don't want that in your body). Transplantation of these new cells into diabetic mice seem to roll back the disease state, so this is another one to try in humans. The tricky part is the keep the immune system from rejecting them (the problem with cell transplants for diabetes in general), but they've managed to protect them in the mouse models, and there's a lot of work going into this part of the idea as well for human trials. This could be very promising indeed, and could, if things go right, be a flat-out cure for many Type I patients. Now that would be an advance.
