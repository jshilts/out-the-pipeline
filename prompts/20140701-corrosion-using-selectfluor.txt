Corrosion Using Selectfluor?
1 Jul 2014

Here's a question for those of you who've used Selectfluor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selectfluor) (Air Products trademark), the well-known fluorinating reagent. I've had an email from someone at Sigma-Aldrich, wondering if people have noticed corrosion problems with either glass or stainless steel when using or storing the reagent. I've hardly used it myself, so I don't have much to offer, but I figured that there was a lot of chemical experience out in the blog's readership, and someone may have something to add.
