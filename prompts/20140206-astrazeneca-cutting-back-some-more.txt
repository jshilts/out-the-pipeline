AstraZeneca Cutting Back - Some More
6 Feb 2014

AstraZeneca has announced (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/astrazeneca-adds-550-jobs-chopping-block-profits-shrivel/2014-02-06) that they're cutting back, yet again. 550 more jobs are being shed, but (unhelpfully) they're not saying what divisions of the company will shrink. More details as they arise - I would assume (or at least hope) that the folks working at AZ have more details, but you can't be sure of that, can you? This company and Eli Lilly continue to be in the worst shape among the big pharmas.
