InterMune Comes Through
25 Feb 2014

Back in 2010, I wrote about InterMune's drug for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pirfenidone. The company's stock shot up (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2010/03/11/intermunes_rise) on hopes that the compound would make it through the FDA, and then went straight back down (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2010/05/05/intermune_right_back_down_again) when those proved ill-founded. The agency asked them for more data, and I wondered at the time if they'd be able to raise enough cash to generate it. 
 Well, they did, and the effort appears to have been worth it (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/intermune-scores-big-win-phiii-lung-drug-study/2014-02-25) : the company says it met all its endpoints in Phase III, and is headed back to the FDA with what appears to be a solid story. Note that this press release, as opposed to the Pfizer one that I was mentioning earlier today (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/02/25/for_immediate_rewording_uh_release) , is full of data (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/press-releases/intermune-reports-phase-3-ascend-trial-results-pirfenidone-idiopathic-pulmo) . 
 The company's stock has shot up, once again. If you've been an InterMune investor over the last few years, your fingernails are probably in bad shape and your combover is no longer plausible. The stock has had wild moves on rumors of takeovers (or lack of same) and anticipation of these clinical results. But good for them: they stuck with their compound, and it looks like it's paid off. And, just as a side note, good for people with fibrosis, too, eh?
