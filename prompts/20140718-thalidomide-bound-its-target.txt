Thalidomide, Bound to Its Target
18 Jul 2014

There's a new report (http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature13527.html?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20140717) in the literature on the mechanism of thalidomide (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide) , so I thought I'd spend some time talking about the compound. Just mentioning the name to anyone familiar with its history is enough to bring on a shiver. The compound, administered as a sedative/morning sickness remedy to pregnant women in the 1950s and early 1960s, famously brought on a wave of severe birth defects. There's a lot of confusion about this event in the popular literature, though - some people don't even realize that the drug was never approved in the US, although this was a famous save by the (then much smaller) FDA and especially by Frances Oldham Kelsey (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Oldham_Kelsey) . And even those who know a good amount about the case can be confused by the toxicology, because it's confusing: no phenotype in mice and rats, but big reproductive tox trouble rabbits (and humans, of course). And as I mentioned here (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2002/11/11/thalidomide_in_the_mirror) , the compound is often used as an example of the far different effects of different enantiomers. But practically speaking, that's not the case: thalidomide has a very easily racemized chiral center, which gets scrambled in vivo . It doesn't matter if you take the racemate or a pure enantiomer; you're going to get both of the isomers once it's in circulation. 
 The compound's horrific effects led to a great deal of research on its mechanism. Along the way, thalidomide itself was found to be useful in the treatment of leprosy, and in recent years it's been approved for use in multiple myeloma and other cancers. (This led to an unusual lawsuit (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2009/08/26/thalidomide_for_myeloma_whose_idea_was_it) claiming credit for the idea). It's a potent anti-angiogenic compound, among other things, although the precise mechanism is still a matter for debate - in vivo , the compound has effects on a number of wide-ranging growth factors (and these were long thought to be the mechanism underlying its effects on embryos). Those embryonic effects complicate the drug's use immensely - Celgene, who got it through trials and approval for myeloma, have to keep a very tight patient registry, among other things, and control its distribution carefully. Experience has shown that turning thalidomide loose will always end up with someone (i.e. a pregnant woman) getting exposed to it who shouldn't be - it's gotten to the point that the WHO no longer recommends it for use in leprosy treatment, despite its clear evidence of benefit, and it's down to just those problems of distribution and control. 
 But in 2010, it was reported (http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=20223979) that the drug binds to a protein called cereblon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereblon) (CRBN), and this mechanism implicated the ubiquitin ligase (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin_ligase) system in the embryonic effects. That's an interesting and important (http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2004/) pathway - ubiquitin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin) is, as the name implies, ubiquitous, and addition of a string of ubiquitins to a protein is a universal disposal tag in cells: off to the proteosome, to be torn to bits. It gets stuck onto exposed lysine residues by the aforementioned ligase enzyme. 
 But less-thorough ubiquitination is part of other pathways. Other proteins can have ubiquitin recognition domains, so there are signaling events going on. Even poly-ubiquitin chains can be part of non-disposal processes - the usual oligomers are built up using a particular lysine residue on each ubiquitin in the chain, but there are other lysine possibilities, and these branch off into different functions. It's a mess, frankly, but it's an important mess, and it's been the subject of a lot of work over the years in both academia and industry. 
 The new paper has the crystal structure of thalidomide (and two of its analogs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_and_development_of_thalidomide_and_its_analogs) ) bound to the ubiquitin ligase complex. It looks like they keep one set of protein-protein interactions from occurring while the ligase end of things is going after other transcription factors to tag them for degradation. Ubiquitination of various proteins could be either up- or downregulated by this route. Interestingly, the binding is indeed enantioselective, which suggests that the teratogenic effects may well be down to the (S) enantiomer, not that there's any way to test this in vivo (as mentioned above). But the effects of these compounds in myeloma appear to go through (http://dx.doi.org/10.1182/blood-2011-05-356063) the cereblon pathway as well, so there's never going to be a thalidomide-like drug without reproductive tox. If you could take it a notch down the pathway and go for the relevant transcription factors instead (http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6168/305) , post-cereblon, you might have something, but selective targeting of transcription factors is a hard row to hoe.
