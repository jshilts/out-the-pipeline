The Real Numbers on Tamiflu
16 May 2014

I've been meaning to cover this controversy (http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/10/tamiflu-saga-drug-trials-big-pharma) about Tamiflu (oseltamivir). The Cochrane group has reviewed all the clinical data obtainable on the drug's efficacy, and has concluded that it doesn't have much. That's in contrast to an earlier review they'd conducted in 2008, which said that, overall, the evidence was slightly positive. 
 But as Ben Goldacre details in that Guardian piece, a comment left on the Cochrane paper pointed out that the positive conclusions were almost entirely due to one paper. That one summarized ten clinical studies, but only two of the ten had ever appeared in the literature. And this sent the Cochrane Collaboration on a hunt (http://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b5164) to find the rest of the data, which turned out to be no simple matter: 
 First, the Cochrane researchers wrote to the authors of the Kaiser paper. By reply, they were told that this team no longer had the files: they should contact Roche. Here the problems began. Roche said it would hand over some information, but the Cochrane reviewers would need to sign a confidentiality agreement. This was tricky: Cochrane reviews are built around showing their working, but Roche's proposed contract would require them to keep the information behind their reasoning secret from readers. More than this, the contract said they were not allowed to discuss the terms of their secrecy agreement, or publicly acknowledge that it even existed. . .Then, in October 2009, the company changed tack. It would like to hand over the data, it explained, but another academic review on Tamiflu was being conducted elsewhere. Roche had given this other group the study reports, so Cochrane couldn't have them. 
 And so on and very much so on. Roche's conduct here appears shameful, and just the sort of thing that has lowered the public opinion of the entire pharma industry. And not just the public opinion: it's lowered the industry in the eyes of legislators and regulators, who have even more direct power to change the way pharma does business. Over the years, we've been seeing a particularly nasty Tragedy of the Commons - each individual company, when they engage in tactics like this to product an individual drug, lowers the general standing of the industry a bit more, but no one company has the incentive to worry about that common problem. They have more immediate concerns. 
 So what about Tamiflu? After years of wrangling, the data finally emerged, and they're not all that impressive: 
 So does Tamiflu work? From the Cochrane analysis – fully public – Tamiflu does not reduce the number of hospitalisations. There wasn't enough data to see if it reduces the number of deaths. It does reduce the number of self-reported, unverified cases of pneumonia, but when you look at the five trials with a detailed diagnostic form for pneumonia, there is no significant benefit. It might help prevent flu symptoms, but not asymptomatic spread, and the evidence here is mixed. It will take a few hours off the duration of your flu symptoms. 
 I've never considered (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2006/01/19/tamiflu_good_for_anything_or_not) it much of a drug, personally, and that's without any access to all this hard-to-get data. One of the biggest raps (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2005/11/02/the_flu_plan_part_two_antiviral_drugs) on oseltamivir is that it has always appeared to be most effective if it could be taken after you've been infected, but before you know you're sick. That's not a very useful situation for the real world, since a person can come down with the flu any time at all during the winter. Goldacre again: 
 Roche has issued a press release saying it contests these conclusions, but giving no reasons: so now we can finally let science begin. It can shoot down the details of the Cochrane review – I hope it will – and we will edge towards the truth. This is what science looks like. Roche also denies being dragged to transparency, and says it simply didn't know how to respond to Cochrane. This, again, speaks to the pace of change. I have no idea why it was withholding information: but I rather suspect it was simply because that's what people have always done, and sharing it was a hassle, requiring new norms to be developed. That's reassuring and depressing at the same time. 
 That sounds quite likely. No one wants to be the person who sets a new precedent in dealing with clinical data, especially not at a company the size of Roche, so what we might have here is yet another tragedy of the commons: it would have been in the company's best interest to have not gone through this whole affair, but there may have been no one person there who felt as if they were in any position to do something about it. When in doubt, go with the status quo: that's the unwritten rule, and the larger the organization, the stronger it holds. After all, if it's a huge, profitable company, the status quo clearly has a lot going for it, right? It's worked so far - who are you, or that guy over there, to think about rearranging it?
