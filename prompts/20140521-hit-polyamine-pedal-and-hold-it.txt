Hit the Polyamine Pedal, And Hold It
21 May 2014

As part of the no-doubt-endless series of head-shaking natural product structures out there, allow me to present the newly described (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ol5011888) Protoaculeine B, isolated from an Okinawan marine sponge. That side chain looks as if it were inspired by listening to Philip Glass, and it fits well into the category of "I never would have made that in a million years", which so many natural products seem to occupy. But even freakier things await discovery, of that we can be sure.
