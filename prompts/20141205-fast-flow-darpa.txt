Fast Flow For DARPA
5 Dec 2014

For you flow chemistry fans, here's a paper (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201409093/abstract) on the flow equivalent of speed chess: a three-minute synthesis and purification of ibuprofen. Three bond-forming steps, one work-up, and one purification all take place in that time, producing about 8g/hour of final product. Notable features include the use of aluminum chloride, which is the sort of reagent that most flow syntheses try to avoid, aluminum workups being widely known for their gunky, sticky, frozen-yogurt-like properties. 
 This work, from the Jamison lab at MIT, was funded by DARPA, and it's far from the only "on-demand drug synthesis" project I've seen them fund. A lot of interesting flow chemistry and in-line processing has come out of this stuff, but I have to admit, I'm still a bit puzzled about DARPA's rationale for the whole thing. I gather that the eventual futuristic goal would be some sort of gizmo that can be taken into the field and which will crank out fresh pharmaceutical supplies on demand. But that means carrying along a lot of extra mass for reagents whose components have to be thrown away (like, say, the oxide gunk left from an aluminum chloride workup). And it also means carrying along a lot of ingredients that are more storage-sensitive than the final products as well, like aluminum chloride, or (also in the current paper) iodine monochloride. 
 So all in all, it would seem easier to ship or carry some ibuprofen rather than an ibuprofen-making machine. A machine of the same size that could synthesize a wide range of useful drugs would be easier to make the case for, naturally, but organic synthesis may not allow you to do that, or not yet. It starts to get into the territory of the old Star Trek method of feeding the crew: tell the wall what you want, and then reach in and take it out of the slot. I have no problem with DARPA trying to push into unknown territory - that's their job - but there's a lot of territory here to cover.
