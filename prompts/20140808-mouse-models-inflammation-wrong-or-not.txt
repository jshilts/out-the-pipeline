Mouse Models of Inflammation: Wrong Or Not?
8 Aug 2014

I wrote here (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/02/13/mouse_models_of_inflammation_are_basically_worthless_now_we_know) about a study (http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/02/07/1222878110) that suggested that mice are a poor model for human inflammation. That paper created quite a splash - many research groups had experienced problems in this area, and this work seemed to offer a compelling reason for why that should happen. 
 Well, let the arguing commence, because now there's another paper out (http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/07/31/1401965111.abstract) (also in PNAS) that analyzes the same data set and comes to the opposite conclusion (http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/same-data-opposite-conclusion-mice-really-are-models-of-human-inflammation/81250198/) . The authors of this new paper are specifically looking at the genes whose expression changed the most in both mice and humans, and they report a very high correlation. (The previous paper looked at the mouse homologs of human genes, among other things). 
 I'm not enough of a genomics person to say immediately who's correct here. Could they both be right: most gene and pathway changes are different in human and mouse inflammation, but the ones that change the most are mostly the same? But there's something a bit weird in this new paper: the authors report P values that are so vanishingly small that I have trouble believing them. How about ten to the minus thirty-fifth? Have you ever in your life heard of such a thing? In whole-animal biology, yet? That alone makes me wonder what's going on. Seeing a P-value the size of Planck's constant just seems wrong, somehow.
