Oh Brave New World
8 May 2014

So since we've already had some real synthetic biology (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/05/08/artificial_base_pairs_in_living_cells) this morning, how about some wild-eyed fantasy? Because that's what this is (http://gigaom.com/2014/05/03/the-gigaom-interview-why-synthetic-biology-and-the-netflix-model-are-the-future-of-medicine/) (link courtesy of Chemjobber (http://chemjobber.blogspot.com) ). Here you go, see what you think: 
 Molecular biologist and futurist Andrew Hessel . . .envisions a world in which every individual receives pharmaceutical drugs perfectly formulated to their genetic and medical needs for a fraction of what treatment would currently cost. . . 
 (Says Hessel): "I’m driven by the idea that one day anyone with cancer, no matter what or where, (can get) a cheap genetic screen and some sort of molecular pathology … and have a computer generated medicine generated in hours. It’s not sold to them, it’s just available on subscription. Have you seen Dallas Buyers Club? Don’t sell the medicine, sell the subscription. The biggest change here is that you can make medicines for one person, so the blockbuster model no longer applies." 
 Well, that's all right, then. For some values of "one day", he might even be correct. But the problem with interviews like this (which the early-1990s issues of Wired used to specialize in) is that they make all this stuff sound like it's just about to start rolling out of someone's garage. Once again, we see the difference between the computer-based tech world, where software (and sometimes hardware) can indeed roll out of someone's garage, and biomedical research, where it ain't so swift. 
 As you read further, you realize that the "medicines" he's talking about are engineered viruses, which he seems to believe are such well-validated tools in oncology and infectious disease that they're ready for everyone to start cranking them out and dosing themselves in the spare bedroom. Really, the only thing standing in the way are the old fossils who don't understand how the world works today: 
 There is a challenge in getting people beyond the automatic fear of the word virus or the engineering thereof. Certainly, the kind of idea that anyone is going to use these tools to make Ebola or smallpox is kind of laughable. I think we’ve figured out those blocks. But, the potentials for positive engineering are so dramatic, particularly when it comes to making medicines. 
 I think it’s going to take a generational change in the end. Younger people aren’t afraid of these technologies in the same way that people my age typically are. They grow up learning about molecular biology in school. So, on those fronts, they’re much more comfortable with the technology and also with the idea of sharing. You know, the privacy issues are very different for younger people today than for older people. 
 I don't really know how to respond to this stuff. I mean, I get flak from people sometimes for being too optimistic and too enthusiastic about new stuff I just read about in the literature, but sheesh - this guy, and his tribe (which is not a small one) are ascending into the clouds and leaving people like me reading the vapor trails. This, to me, is a perfect example of someone who thinks that the way that (say) Twitter and Instagram were founded represents some sort of massive shift in human history, and that somehow the world has transformed into a big digital playground where cool coders make reality do what they want. This sort of talk is what an even-more-curmudgeonly Tom Wolfe once described as "digibabble". 
 Code is mighty and code is powerful, but it's mighty and powerful because we humans all like to use these little electrical-powered boxes to talk to each other. But if you look through a microscope or a telescope, you can see that Man is not the measure of all things, and the universe is full of objects that don't know or care about what humans like to do. Viruses are very much in that category. They're not just little bits of software, not quite, even though they might be the closest approximation to it in the real world. 
 But that's not close enough. That's why (just to pick one example) I don't actually find the idea of someone engineering an awful infectious virus to be "kind of laughable". In a world where doomsday cults have released home-made nerve gas into the Tokyo subway, where raving lunatics armed with machine guns and RPGs abduct schoolgirls by the hundreds to sell them off, where. . .well, do I have to go on? You can read the headlines as well as I can. It seems abundantly clear to me, even with my sunny disposition, that there are people in this world who would rejoice at the idea of being able to engineer their own Sneezing Ebola, and the idea gives me the willies. Let's hope some of those crazy social-media kids, the ones who, like, grew up hearing about molecular biology, can then whip up an open-source vaccine and tell the rest of us about it with Vine or something! 
 Postscript: at the same time, I actually think that genie of distributed biotechnology (like most genies) will resist being stuffed back into the bottle. On balance, I still think that it's a good thing, but there are some very big things on both sides of that balance.

 Update: I wanted to highlight this comment (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/05/08/oh_brave_new_world.php#1459336) by Markysparky, because it's so darn excellent: 
 "Classic riddles become more interesting in this guy's reality... 
 Q: How to cross a river in a double-occupancy rowboat with a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage? 
 A: Engineer a GMO cabbage that produces a goat-repellant molecule. Train the wolf to be vegetarian through an artificial intelligence-powered app on your iPad. Erect a solar farm to power an electric fence to contain the goat. Use drones to move items instead of rowboats. Make goat-armor with 3D printing. Use Uber to summon additional boats. etc etc"
