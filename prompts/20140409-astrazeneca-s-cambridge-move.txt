They've set up an agreement with the Medical Research Council to have MRC people working "alongside" AZ people, although details seem pretty short on how that's going to happen in practice. Here's some of it, though: 
 Within the AstraZeneca MRC UK Centre for Lead Discovery, the academics will get access to more than 2 million compounds in AstraZeneca's library and have the use of high-tech screening equipment to study diseases and possible treatments. 
 Their research proposals will be assessed by the MRC, which will fund up to 15 projects a year and AstraZeneca will have the first option to license any resulting drug discovery programs. 
 I liked this part of the article as well: 
 Other large drugmakers have built research outposts in life science centers like Cambridge, Boston and San Francisco - but none have undertaken such a wholesale move of operations. 
 The strategy is not without risks, especially if the upheaval disrupts current research projects or results in key staff leaving the company. A smooth transition is seen as a key test for CEO Soriot as he tries to change the culture at AstraZeneca to put science at the center of its activities. 
 What was at the center of AZ's operations before?
