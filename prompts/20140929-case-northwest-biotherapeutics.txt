The Case of Northwest Biotherapeutics
29 Sep 2014

There have been a lot of strong words exchanged about Northwest Biotherapeutics (NWBO), a small Maryland-based company developing a brain cancer vaccine. Over at Fierce Biotech, they're wondering (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/uk-picks-controversial-brain-cancer-vaccine-its-1st-new-innovative-medicine/2014-09-16) why this program was picked by the UK authorities as their first official "Promising Innovative Medicine", given the scarcity of data (and the dismal track record of dendritic vaccines in the field). 
 Adam Feuerstein has said a bunch of similar things, vigorously, at TheStreet.com over the last few months as well. He's been especially skeptical of the company's own vigorous PR efforts, and in general tends to be unenthusiastic (http://seekingalpha.com/article/1665532-a-public-apology-to-adam-feuerstein-on-northwest-biotherapeutics) about small go-it-alone oncology programs. The Feuerstein-Ratain rule (http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/09/26/jnci.djr375.full) , that small-cap cancer trials fail, has been hard to refute (http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/01/18/will-the-feuerstein-ratain-rule-hold-in.aspx) . 
 Well, just the other day Washington Post columnist Steven Pearlstein waded into this story with a piece (http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/northwest-biotherapeutics-stock-woes-highlight-the-harm-of-short-sales/2014/09/26/78b99b0a-4507-11e4-b47c-f5889e061e5f_story.html) about how evil short-sellers are hurting promising little biotech companies. That's pretty much the tone of the whole thing, and he uses Feuerstein and NWBO as his prime example, with not-quite-stated allegations of collusion with short-sellers. 
 My belief is that this is a load of crap, from someone who doesn't understand very much about how the stock market works. Small companies that have been unable to interest anyone else in their technologies have a difficult time of it, to be sure. But we don't need to go to conspiracy theories to explain this. There are indeed short-selling investors who are trying to drive stocks down, but they are absolutely overwhelmed in number by the number of people who are trying to drive stocks up. That's what a stock market is: differences of opinion, held strongly enough for money to be put down on them. 
 If you look at Feuerstein's most recent column (http://www.thestreet.com/story/12885672/1/northwest-bios-almost-toxic-debt-raise-responsible-for-stock-slide.html) on NWBO, you find that only one other company has even applied for the "Promising Innovative Medicine" designation (and that application is in process). So this is not some incredible milestone. And you also find a lot of useful information on the company's debt structure, the exact sort of thing that an investor in the company should be interested in. Will you get these details by reading press releases from Northwest Biotherapeutics? You will not. You will get them from people who are willing to scrutinize a company, its operations, and its pipeline in detail. 
 Does Steven Pearlstein think that these details about NWBO's debt deal are false? He should say so. But he also talks about short-sellers crippling Dendreon, which ignores completely the fact that what's crippled Dendreon is that their vaccine doesn't work very well (http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/30/us-provenge-idUSBRE82T07420120330) . Wonderful drugs don't get buried by short-sellers. Drugs get buried by data. 
 Update: TheStreet.com is now seeking a retraction (http://www.thestreet.com/story/12896216/1/thestreet-seeks-retraction-from-washington-post-on-steven-pearlstein-column.html) from Pearlstein. One of the key sentences is "Mr. Pearlstein -- who said he knew nothing about biotech or medicine . . ." Pretty much had that part figured out already. The letter to the Post goes on to claim a number of other serious deficiencies with Pearlstein's reporting. It's going to be interesting to see where this leads. . .
