A New Metabolism Predictor
14 Jan 2014

Drug metabolism is a perennial topic for us small-molecule people. Watching your lovingly optimized molecules go through the shredding-machine of the liver is an instructive (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/01/31/in_case_you_were_wondering_what_we_thought_about_the_liver) experience, not least when you consider how hard it would be for you to do some of the chemistry that it does. (For reference and getting up to speed on the details, the comments section here has had reader recommendations for the Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics Quick Guide (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/144195628X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=144195628X&linkCode=as2&tag=lagniappe-20) ). 
 Here's a review of a new sites-of-metabolism predictor, FAME (http://www.macinchem.org/reviews/fame/fame) , a decision-tree type program that's been trained on data from 20,000 known compounds. It handles both Phase I and Phase II metabolism (a "Pharma 101" entry on that topic is here (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2002/12/22/clearance_sale) , for those who'd like to know more), and it looks like it's well worth considering if you're in need for something like this. 
 Here's my question for the med-chem and PK types: have you made use of predictive metabolism software? Did it save you time, or did you either go down the wrong alleys or not see anything you wouldn't have predicted yourself? I'm interested in real-world experiences, since I haven't had too many myself in this area.
