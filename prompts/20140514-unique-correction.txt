A Unique Correction
14 May 2014

A reader sent this correction notice (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ml500149q) along this morning, and I agree: I've never seen anything quite like it. Here's how it goes (emphasis added): 
 According to the recent reconsideration and re-evaluation of every author’s contribution of this work, all of authors have reached the final conclusion that we should rearrange the order of the authors and remove Dr. Usui from the author list as observed below. 
 (List of authors follows) 
 All of authors have already approved this correction. Dr. Usui, our supervisor, also authorized and approved it. 
 There's surely a story here, but I'm sure that I don't quite know what it is, either!
