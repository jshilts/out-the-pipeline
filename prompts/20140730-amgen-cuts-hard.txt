Amgen Cuts Hard
30 Jul 2014

Amgen cuts over 2,500 jobs. Amgen completely shuts down its big facilities in Washington state and Colorado. Amgen's stock goes up nearly 7% in one day, adding about five (corrected late-night mistake) billion dollars in market cap. And there you have it. That's the industry. 
 As this FierceBiotech piece (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/amgen-axing-thousands-staffers-major-restructuring/2014-07-29) says, Amgen's big shareholders have been unhappy with the way the company has been performing during the recent biotech bull market. This also puts the company in line with all the other big outfits who have been trimming staff and consolidating research sites in the past few years. It also puts them in line with all the companies who have been consolidating particularly in the Boston/Cambridge and San Francisco Bay areas - thisBoston Globearticle (http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/07/29/amgen-says-will-cut-jobs-nationally-but-expand-its-cambridge-biotechnology-research-site/XyQf0YoJzMTMDLxbrKcUaK/story.html) Boston Globe says that positions will actually be added in both of those Amgen locations. So no one can say that they're behind the times now. 
 And if you'd like to know more about just what state the industry is in, have a look (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/analyst-amgens-moonshot-rd-spending-bad-business/2014-06-13) at analyst Geoffrey Porges' take on Amgen's portfolio. It's too damn innovative , he says: 
 Over the last 10 years, the company has spent about $30 billion on R&D--including buyouts--but generated just $15 billion in cumulative revenue from the resulting drugs, he points out in a research note Friday. And, looking at Amgen's current pipeline, Porges doesn't see that ratio evening out any time soon. 
 That's because of Amgen's affinity for risk. Compared to its Big Biotech peers, the company has a pipeline particularly loaded with what Porges terms "breakthrough" assets: first-in-class agents with unproven targets and unknown safety profiles. At the moment, 80% of Amgen's pipeline is made up of such breakthrough therapies, according to Bernstein's numbers. . .That commitment to inherently risky science, coupled with a "quixotic" M&A track record, has saddled Amgen with a below-average return on invested capital over the past four years, Porges writes, suggesting "changes to the company's strategy and structure may be warranted." 
 To be fair, he's suggesting a change that puts the cash-cow parts of the company in a separate place from the risky parts, and he claims that the two resulting companies would have a higher combined market cap than Amgen as it currently exists. But for those people who feel that the still-profitable legacy drugs are there to pay for the risky R&D (which could become the legacy drugs of the future), this scheme may not sound very appealing. How the new company with all the risky programs might survive if it runs into trouble is apparently not Porges' department. Raising Amgen's market cap is, though. But consider it raised, as of today: an all-time high, as a matter of fact. All it took was a whacking big layoff and a string of site closures - why, success has been around the corner all this time.
