Rumblings About AstraZeneca and Antibiotics
28 Oct 2014

Well, let's get the rest of today's bad news out there. There are persistent reports that AstraZeneca is going to be getting rid of the rest of its antibiotics research. David Shlaes' blog (http://antibiotics-theperfectstorm.blogspot.fr/2014/10/astrazeneca-is-cutting-and-running.html) is the source of this one, and he may well have some information from people who know. The company's response has not been encouraging, either. Here's what they told (http://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2014/10/24/is-astrazeneca-getting-ready-to-exit-antibiotics-research/) Ed Silverman at Pharmalot: 
 ". . .we have previously said on a number of occasions that we would take an opportunity-driven approach in our non-core therapeutic areas of infection and neuroscience,” she continues. “This means we would focus our resources on the core therapeutic areas and look for opportunities to maximize the value of our pipeline infection and neuroscience." 
 Oh, dear. When they start talking about opportunities and maximizing value, it's generally a very bad sign. Sauve qui peut is the usual reaction to this sort of statement, and I can't say that it would be inappropriate.
