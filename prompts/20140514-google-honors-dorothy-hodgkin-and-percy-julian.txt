Google Honors Dorothy Hodgkin and Percy Julian
14 May 2014

Google has recently marked the birthdays of Percy Julian (http://www.google.com/doodles/percy-julians-115th-birthday) and Dorothy Hodgkin (http://www.google.com/doodles/dorothy-hodgkins-104th-birthday) , which is good of them, since both were outstanding chemists. And neither, it's safe to say, are known to the general public (no chemists are known to the general public). Not even all chemists today could tell you a lot about either of them, which is a shame as well. (Both of them show up in my "Chemistry Book" manuscript). 
 Percy Julian (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Lavon_Julian) was a very accomplished natural products chemist, who made a large mark on the steroid field in its heroic days of the 1940s and 1950s. And he was black, born in 1899 in Montgomery, Alabama, which meant that the deck was very much stacked against his making a large mark of any kind, anywhere. His grandfather had been a slave, but his parents, greatly to their credit, strongly encouraged all their children to become well educated. 
 In Percy Julian's case, he did just that, but with many difficulties. He was Phi Beta Kappa at DePauw, but the university (like its town) was largely segregated. He went on to Harvard, but had no hope of obtaining a PhD there, as the university withdrew his teaching assistantship - he later completed his doctorate in Vienna, becoming perhaps the third black American chemist with a PhD at all. Later on, when he had moved from academia to industry, DuPont turned him down for a position, saying that they had been "unaware that he was a Negro". In later years, his house outside Chicago was fire-bombed when he moved his family in. So he had a hard way up, by anyone's standards. His biographical details also show that he was someone with a very strong personality, which didn't always smooth the way, either, but no one without a strong personality would have been able to make any way at all against such headwinds. 
 There must be a book describing the early days of steroid chemistry, but I haven't seen it. Perhaps it would have to be a bit too technical for a general readership, but the days in which Julian worked in steroids were like nothing seen before or since. Russell Marker getting his giant Mexican yams stolen off the top of a bus, the founding of Syntex, the rush to find new routes to some of the most exciting (and lucrative) molecules in the world, chemical intermediates being shipped under armed guard: it's a wild story featuring some pretty wild people, and Percy Julian was right in the middle of it (http://www.chemheritage.org/discover/online-resources/chemistry-in-history/themes/pharmaceuticals/restoring-and-regulating-the-bodys-biochemistry/julian--marker--djerassi.aspx) , at Glidden and later at his own company, Julian Laboratories. His work shifted the entire steroid industry towards soybeans as a feedstock, among other things. 
 Dorothy Hodgkin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Hodgkin) was for some time the outstanding X-ray crystallographer in the world. Considering the treatment of ambitious female scientists in the 1930s, this was an even more extraordinary feat. There were plenty of scientific difficulties as well. Given the X-ray sources available (feeble, by any modern standard) and the computational tools of the time (nonexistent, by any modern standard), the crystallography of any complex molecule was a major undertaking. But Hodgkin worked out the first X-ray structure of a steroid, the structure of penicillin (in 1945), and the structure of vitamin B12, among many others. She also took on the problem of protein structure, well before the tools of the science were ready for it, and she was one of the main reasons that the field advanced enough so that by the 1960s protein structures were actually beginning to be solved. Her first crack at the insulin structure was in 1934, which shows an extraordinary degree of scientific bravery when you consider what sort of problem this was at the time. This level of work won her a well-deserved Nobel (http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1964/hodgkin-bio.html) . 
 Hodgkin's personality was also complex. Like her mentor and colleague, J. D. Bernal (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Desmond_Bernal) , she had what I can only characterize as a lifelong weakness for communism, and an apparent blind spot about it and its history which now looks like something that must have covered half the sky. Both she and Bernal are on record with some extraordinary statements about Stalin and other communist leaders, which might barely have been excused in the early 1930s, but continued long afterwards. See, for example, Hodgkins' own cringe-inducing forward (http://vaisamar.wordpress.com/2012/10/15/the-greatest-intellectual-fraud-in-romanian-history-on-elena-ceausescus-doctoral-dissertation/) to a volume of chemical research allegedly by Elena Ceausescu, the horrible and fraudulent wife of the Romanian dictator. Perhaps, as Montesquieu says of Pompey, she went on saying these things mainly because she'd always said them, but her case (and Bernal's, and Haldane (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._S._Haldane) 's and others) make for an interesting and somewhat depressing psychological study. 
 Great works in both art and science, though, are often done by people whose other opinions can be all over the landscape, and Hodgkins did indisputably great work in her field. She also inspired great personal affection and respect - Margaret Thatcher was a student of hers at Oxford, and could not have possibly disagreed with anyone more about the Soviet Union and many other topics, but she had Hodgkins' portrait hung at 10 Downing Street while she was Prime Minister. 
 Now for a sensitive topic. The natural suspicion, when something like these Google tributes come up, is to assume that Hodgkin is getting recognition because she was a woman and Julian because he was black. This is one of the more insidious effects of discrimination (and of attempts to remediate it), this conscious or unconscious devaluation of achievement. Both Hodgkin and Julian would have made the history books not matter what their gender or color, but their ability to accomplish what they did in spite of those factors makes them even more worthy of recognition. The goal (I would say) is for no one to give a damn about any of these things, and to look with wonder on the days when they were so bizarrely important. But they were important then, and how. Growing up black in the Deep South was no joke, and neither was trying to make headway in Oxford and Cambridge as a woman. Julian, Hodgkins, and others deserve recognition both for what they did and the conditions under which they were able to do it.
