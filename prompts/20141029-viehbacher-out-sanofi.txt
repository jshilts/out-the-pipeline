Viehbacher Out at Sanofi
29 Oct 2014

The talk of Chris Viehbacher being in trouble (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/10/27/sanofi_trouble_at_the_top) with Sanofi's board of directors was accurate: he's been dismissed (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-29/sanofi-chief-viehbacher-ousted-after-board-tensions.html) . It was a unanimous vote, and the chairman cited (http://online.wsj.com/articles/sanofi-fires-ceo-christopher-viehbacher-1414571451) a lack of trust and a "solitary management style" as factors. (This after a statement yesterday by Viehbacher that CEO succession wasn't on the board's agenda - they really weren't communicating, it appears). 
 They must have really wanted him out of there before he made any more solitary moves, though, because no replacement has been lined up yet. But if the board brings up a more clubbable Frenchman from inside the company, that probably won't go down well with the investment community, who seem to have been OK with Viehbacher for the most part. Look for some top-level people at other companies to be taking some sudden vacation days over the next few weeks. The company's partners, Regeneron in particular, will be hoping that the search is short. 
 Update: Matthew Herper says that this is a bad idea (http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2014/10/29/dear-sanofi-firing-ceo-chris-viehbacher-is-a-huge-mistake/) .
