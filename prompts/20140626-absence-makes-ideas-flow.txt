Absence Makes the Ideas Flow?
26 Jun 2014

Something I've noticed for many years now is that I tend to get the most number of chemical ideas - bench chemistry relating to my current work - when I'm in a big conference room far removed from my actual lab. Take me off site, send me to a distant meeting, and I get all sorts of brainstorms about what I should be doing in front of my hood. Does anyone else have this problem (if it is a problem?) I write down all the things I'm thinking of, naturally, so I can actually get around to doing them. But it's funny how the ideas seem to come out of hiding once I'm not actually doing the work.
