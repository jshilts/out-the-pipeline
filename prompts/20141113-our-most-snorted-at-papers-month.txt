Our Most Snorted-At Papers This Month. . .
13 Nov 2014

You know, this is something that I hadn't thought of. Those papers with the egregious mistakes in them, the ones that we all enjoy making fun of? The traffic that comes in to them skews the journal metrics (http://nsaunders.wordpress.com/2014/11/13/measuring-quality-is-hard/) . I wonder how many journals have some of their "Most viewed/shared articles" lists dominated by the ones that everyone comes to laugh at or roll their eyes about? (That link has a good one that I hadn't come across - see the first one on the list).
