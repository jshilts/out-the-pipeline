Shuffling the Departments
22 Apr 2014

So word comes (http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/22/us-novartis-idUSBREA3L07T20140422) this morning of some big transactions between Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline, and Eli Lilly: 
 Novartis said it had agreed to buy GlaxoSmithKline's oncology products for $14.5 billion, while selling to GSK its vaccines, excluding flu, for $7.1 billion plus royalties and creating a joint venture with GSK in consumer healthcare. 
 Novartis also said it had agreed to sell its animal health arm to Eli Lilly for approximately $5.4 billion. 
 The global pharmaceuticals sector has seen a flurry of deal-making recently as large companies seek to focus on a small number of leading businesses, while smaller specialty and generic producers seek greater scale. 
 Coming right after that Pfizer/AZ news the other day, this makes a person wonder what else is in the works. What's not clear (in what I've seen so far) is how this will work - for example, is Novartis just buying the existing drugs and the pipeline, and incorporating those into its existing research? What happens then to all the people in GSK's oncology? And so on. We'll see what details emerge. Any info on this is welcome in the comments, as well as speculations on why GSK is giving up the whole oncology area.
