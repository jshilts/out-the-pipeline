Amgen Cuts Harder
28 Oct 2014

Not good news. Amgen has announced (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/amgen-adds-1100-new-job-cuts-its-global-restructuring-plan/2014-10-28) that it's not just cutting (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/07/30/amgen_cuts_hard) 12 to 15% of its employees - it's going to cut 20% of them. So that means over a thousand new layoffs, on top of the ones that have already been put in the hopper. No details yet, that I know of, about where these cuts will take place, but the number of Amgen sites is already fewer than it used to be, so that certainly narrows it down. 
 As with the previous announcement, this one has sent the company's stock straight up. And hey, they're buying back more shares, too. So there is that.
