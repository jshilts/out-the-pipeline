Where The Hot Drugs Come From: Somewhere Else
31 Mar 2014

Over at LifeSciVC, there's a useful look at how many drugs (http://lifescivc.com/2014/03/transformational-late-stage-drugs-delivered-through-deal-making/) are coming into the larger companies via outside deals. As you might have guessed, the answer is "a lot". Looking at a Goldman Sachs list of "ten drugs that could transform the industry", Bruce Booth says: 
 By my quick review, it appears as though ~75% of these drugs originated at firms different from the company that owns them today (or owns most of the asset today) – either via in-licensing deal or via corporate acquisitions. Savvy business and corporate development strategies drove the bulk of the list. . .I suspect that in a review of the entire late stage industry pipeline, the imbalanced ratio of external:internal sourcing would largely be intact. 
 He has details on the ten drugs that Goldman is listing, and on the portfolios of several of the big outfits in the industry, and I think he's right. It would be very instructive to know what the failure rate, industry-wide, of inlicensed compounds like this might be. My guess is that it's still high, but not quite as high as the average for all programs. The inlicensed compounds have had, in theory, more than one set of eyes go over them, and someone had to reach into their wallet after seeing the data, so you'd think that they have to be in a little bit better shape. But a majority still surely fail, given that the industry's rate overall is close to 90% clinical failure (the math doesn't add up if you try to assume that the inlicensed failure rate is too low!) 
 Also of great interest is the "transformational" aspect. We can assume, I think, that most of the inlicensed compounds came from smaller companies - that's certainly how it looks on Bruce's list. This analysis (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2010/11/04/where_drugs_come_from_the_numbers) suggested that smaller companies (and university-derived work) produced more innovative drugs than internal big-company programs, and these numbers might well be telling us the same thing. 
 This topic came up the last time (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/03/10/startups_vs_big_pharma.php?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+InThePipeline+(In+the+Pipeline)) I discussed a post from Bruce, and Bernard Munos suggested in 2009 (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2009/12/11/munos_on_big_companies_and_small_ones) that this might be the case as well. It's too simplistic to just say Small Companies Good, Big Companies Bad, because there are some real counterexamples to both of those assertions. But overall, averaged over the industry, there might be something to it.
