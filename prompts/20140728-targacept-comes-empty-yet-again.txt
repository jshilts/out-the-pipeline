Targacept Comes Up Empty, Yet Again
28 Jul 2014

Targacept's attempt to salvage something by testing TC-5214 for overactive bladder has failed (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/targacepts-litany-trial-failures-continues-yet-another-flop/2014-07-28) . John Carroll at FierceBiotech counts eight straight failed clinical trials (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/07/14/targacept_fumbles_the_bad_news_on_alzheimers) from this company: a record? I don't see anyone beating that very easily, that's for sure. Nicotinic receptors have proven to be a very, very difficult field to work in, and I'm not sure that Targacept has anything left in their tank.
