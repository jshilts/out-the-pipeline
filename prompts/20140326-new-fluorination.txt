Chem. that looks really interesting. Robert Britton's group at Simon Fraser University report using tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2009/CS/b812100c#!divAbstract) as a photochemistry catalyst with N-fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI). This system fluorinates unsubstituted alkanes, as shown at left, and apparently tolerates several functional groups in the process. 
 Note that the amino acids were fluorinated as their hydrochloride salts; the free bases didn't work. There aren't any secondary or tertiary amine substrates in the paper, nor are there any heterocycles, both of which are cause to wonder whenever you see a new fluorination method. But I think I'm going to order up some tungstate, turn on the lamp, and see what I get. 
 Update: via Chemjobber, here's an excellent process chemistry look (http://chemjobber.blogspot.com/2014/03/process-wednesday-trifluoromethylation.html) at scaling up a trifluoromethylation reaction.
