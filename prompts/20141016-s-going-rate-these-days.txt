What's The Going Rate These Days?
16 Oct 2014

Time to break out the pseudonyms for the comments section. I've had a couple of people asking (on both sides of the process) what the starting salaries for medicinal chemists are running in the Boston/Cambridge area. It's been a while since this was much of a topic, sad to say, but there is some hiring going on these days, and people are trying to get a feel for what the going rates are. Companies want to make sure that they're making competitive-but-not-too-generous offers, and applicants want to make sure that they're getting a reasonable one, too, naturally. 
 So anyone with actual data is invited to leave it in the comments section, under whatever name you like. Reports from outside the Boston/Cambridge area (and at other experience levels) are certainly welcome, too, because the same issues apply in other places as well.
