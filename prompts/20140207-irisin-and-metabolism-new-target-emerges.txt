Irisin and Metabolism - A New Target Emerges
7 Feb 2014

Here's something for metabolic disease people to think about: there's a report (http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/63/2/514.short) adding to what we know about the hormone irisin (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FNDC5) , secreted from muscle tissue, that causes some depots of white adipose tissue to become more like energy-burning brown fat (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_adipose_tissue) . In the late 1990s, there were efforts all across the drug industry to find beta-3 adrenoceptor agonists to stimulate brown fat for weight loss and dyslipidemia. None of them ever made it through, and thus the arguments about whether they would actually perform as thought were never really settled. One of the points of contention was how much responsive brown adipose tissue adults had available, but I don't recall anything suspecting that it could be induced. In recent years, though, it's become clear that a number of factors can bring on what's been called "beige fat". 
 Irisin seems to be released in response to exercise, and is just upstream of the important transcriptional regulator PGC-1a (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPARGC1A) . In fact, release (http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/external-ref?access_num=22237023&link_type=MED) of irisin might be the key to a lot of the beneficial effects (http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/ijlink?linkType=ABST&journalCode=ajpregu&resid=300/5/R1115) of exercise, which would be very much worth knowing. In this study, a stabilized version of it, given iv to rodents, had very strong effects on body weight and glucose tolerance, just the sort of thing a lot of people could use. 
 One of the very interesting features of this area, from a drug discovery standpoint, is that no one has identified the irisin receptor just yet. Look for headlines on that one pretty soon, though - you can bet that a lot of people are chasing it as we speak. 
 Update: are human missing out (http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0073680) on this, compared to mice and other species?
