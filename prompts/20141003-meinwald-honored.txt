Meinwald Honored
3 Oct 2014

It's been announced today (http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2014/10/jerrold-meinwald-wins-national-medal-science) that Jerry Meinwald (emeritus at Cornell (http://chemistry.cornell.edu/faculty/detail.cfm?netid=jm63) ) has won the Presidential Medal of Science in chemistry. That's well deserved - his work on natural product pheromone and signaling systems has had an impact all through chemistry, biology, agricultural science, ecology, and beyond. He and Thomas Eisner (http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/31/science/earth/31eisner.html?_r=0) totally changed the way that we look at insect behavior, among others. Their work is the foundation of the whole field of chemical ecology. 
 So congratulations to Prof. Meinwald for a well-deserved honor, one of many he's received in his long career. But there's one that's escaped him:I note that (the late) Prof. Eisner has a Wikipedia entry (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Eisner) , but Meinwald doesn't, which seems to be a bizarre oversight. If I had the time, I'd write one myself - won't someone? 
 Update: there's a page up now (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerrold_Meinwald) , and it's being expanded.
