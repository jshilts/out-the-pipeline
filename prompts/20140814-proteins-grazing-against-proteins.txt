Proteins Grazing Against Proteins
14 Aug 2014

A huge amount of what's actually going on inside living cells involves protein-protein interactions. Drug discovery, for obvious reasons, focuses on the processes that depend on small molecules and their binding sites (thus the preponderance of receptor ligands and enzyme inhibitors), but small molecules are only part of the story in there. 
 And we've learned (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/04/16/the_latest_proteinprotein_compounds) a fair amount (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/03/13/getting_down_to_proteinprotein_compounds) about all this protein-protein deal-making, but there's clearly a lot that we don't understand at all. If we did, perhaps we'd have more compounds that can t arget them (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2009/12/07/why_dont_we_have_more_proteinprotein_drug_molecules) . Here's a very basic topic about which we know very little (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/23235262/) : how tight are the affinities between all these interacting proteins? What's the usual level, and what's the range (http://bmm.cancerresearchuk.org/~bmmadmin/Affinity/) ? What does the variation in binding constants say about the signaling pathways involved, and the sorts of binding surfaces (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pro.2230/abstract) that are being presented? How long do these protein complexes last? How weak can one of these interactions be, and still be physiologically important? 
 A new paper (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201405976/abstract) has something to say about that last part. The authors have found a bacterial system where protein phosphorylation takes place effectively although the affinity between the two partners (K D ) is only around 25 millimolar. That's very weak indeed - for those outside of drug discovery, small-molecule drug affinities are typically well over a million times that level. We don't know how common or important such weak interactions are, but this work suggests that we're going to have to look pretty far up the scale in order to understand things, and that's probably going to require (http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/v7/n6/full/nnano.2012.82.html) new technologies to quantify (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_to_investigate_protein%E2%80%93protein_interactions) such things. Unless we figure out that huge, multipartner protein dance that's going on, with all its moves and time signatures, we're not going to understand biochemistry. The Labanotation (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labanotation) for a cell would be something to see. . .
