A New Way to Study Hepatotoxicity
25 Mar 2014

Every medicinal chemist fears and respects the liver. That's where our drugs go to die, or at least to be severely tested by that organ's array of powerful metabolizing enzymes. Getting a read on a drug candidate's hepatic stability is a crucial part of drug development, but there's an ever bigger prize out there: predicting outright liver toxicity (http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/65/2/166.full) . That, when it happens, is very bad news indeed, and can torpedo a clinical compound that seemed to be doing just fine - up until then. 
 Unfortunately, getting a handle on liver tox has been difficult, even with such strong motivation. It's a tough problem. And given that most drugs are not hepatotoxic, most of the time, any new assay that overpredicts liver tox might be even worse than no assay at all. There's a paper (http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nbt.2838.html) in the latest Nature Biotechnology , though, that looks promising. 
 What the authors (from Stanford and Toronto) are doing is trying to step back to the early mechanism of liver damage. One hypothesis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21199529) has been that the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) inside hepatic cells is the initial signal of trouble. ROS are known to damage biomolecules, of course. But more subtly, they're also known to be involved in a number of pathways used to sense that cellular damage (and in that capacity, seem to be key players in inducing the beneficial effects of exercise, among other things). Aerobic cells have had to deal with the downsides of oxygen for so long that they've learned to make the most of it. 

This work (building on some previous studies (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201303420/abstract) from the same group) uses polymeric nanoparticles. They're semiconductors, and hooked up to be part of a fluorescence or chemiluminescence readout. (They use FRET for peroxynitrite and hypochlorite detection, more indicative of mitochondrial toxicity, and CRET for hydrogen peroxide, more indicative of Phase I metabolic toxicity). The particles are galactosylated to send them towards the liver cells in vivo , confirmed by necropsy and by confocal imaging. The assay system seemed to work well by itself, and in mouse serum, so they dosed it into mice and looked for what happened when the animals were given toxic doses of either acetominophen (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14625346) or isoniazid (http://livertox.nlm.nih.gov/Isoniazid.htm) (both well-known hepatotox compounds at high levels). And it seems to work pretty well - they could image both the fluorescence and the chemiluminescence across a time course, and the dose/responses make sense. It looks like they're picking up nanomolar to micromolar levels of reactive species. They could also show the expected rescue of the acetominophen toxicity with some known agents (like GSH), but could also see differences between them, both in the magnitude of the effects and their time courses as well. 
 The chemiluminescent detection has been done before (http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v6/n10/full/nmat1983.html) , as has the FRET one (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja910090v) , but this one seems to be more convenient to dose, and having both ROS detection systems going at once is nice, too. One hopes that this sort of thing really can provide a way to get a solid in vivo read on hepatotoxicity, because we sure need one. Toxicologists tend to be a conservative bunch, with good reason, so don't look for this to revolutionize the field by the end of the year or anything. But there's a lot of promise here. 
 There are some things to look out for, though. For one, since these are necessarily being done in rodents, there will be differences in metabolism that will have to be taken into account, and some of those can be rather large. Not everything that injures a mouse liver will do so in humans, and vice versa. It's also worth remembering that hepatotoxicity is also a major problem (http://www.fda.gov/drugs/scienceresearch/researchareas/ucm071471.htm) with marketed drugs. That's going to be a much tougher problem to deal with, because some of these cases are due to overdose, some to drug-drug interactions, some to drug-alcohol interactions, and some to factors that no one's been able to pin down. One hopes, though, that if more drugs come through that show a clean liver profile that these problems might ameliorate a bit.
