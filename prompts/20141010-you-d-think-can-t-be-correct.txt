You'd Think That This Can't Be Correct
10 Oct 2014

Well, here's something to think about over the weekend. I last wrote here (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2011/10/31/very_likely_not_real_but_still_the_ecat) in 2011 about the "E-cat", a supposed alternative energy source being touted/developed by Italian inventor Andrea Rossi. Odd and not all that plausible claims of low-energy fusion reactions of nickel isotopes have been made for the device (see the comments section to that post above for more on this), and the whole thing definitely has been staying in my "Probably not real" file. Just to add one complication, Rossi's own past does not appear (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2011/01/25/weirdness_a_cold_fusion_demonstration) to be above reproach. And his conduct (and that of his coworker Sergio Focardi) would seem to be a bit strange during this whole affair. 
 But today there is a preprint (http://www.sifferkoll.se/sifferkoll/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/LuganoReportSubmit.pdf) (PDF) of another outside-opinion test of the device (thanks to Alex Tabarrok of Marginal Revolution (http://marginalrevolution.com/) on Twitter for the heads-up). It has several Swedish co-authors (three from Uppsala and one from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm), and the language is mostly pretty measured. But what it has to say is quite unusual - if it's true. 
 The device itself is no longer surrounded by lead shielding, for one thing. No radiation of any kind appears to be emitted. The test went on for 32 days of continuous operation, and here's the take-home: 
 The quantity of heat emitted constantly by the reactor and the length of time during which the reactor was operating rule out, beyond any reasonable doubt, a chemical reaction as underlying its operation. This is emphasized by the fact that we stand considerably more than two order of magnitudes from the region of the Ragone plot occupied by conventional energy sources. 
 The fuel generating the excessive heat was analyzed with several methods before and after the experimental run. It was found that the Lithium and Nickel content in the fuel had the natural isotopic composition before the run, but after the 32 days run the isotopic composition has changed dramatically both for Lithium and Nickel. Such a change can only take place via nuclear reactions. It is thus clear that nuclear reactions have taken place in the burning process. This is also what can be suspected from the excessive heat being generated in the process. 
 Although we have good knowledge of the composition of the fuel we presently lack detailed information on the internal components of the reactor, and of the methods by which the reaction is primed. Since we are presently not in possession of this information, we think that any attempt to explain the E-Cat heating process would be too much hampered by the lack of this information, and thus we refrain from such discussions. 
 In summary, the performance of the E-Cat reactor is remarkable. We have a device giving heat energy compatible with nuclear transformations, but it operates at low energy and gives neither nuclear radioactive waste nor emits radiation. From basic general knowledge in nuclear physics this should not be possible. . . 
 Told you it was interesting. But I'm waiting for more independent verification. As long as Rossi et al. are so secretive about this device, the smell of fraud will continue to cling to it. I truly am wondering just what's going on here, though. 
 Update: Elforsk, the R&D arm of Sweden's power utility, has said (http://www.nyteknik.se/asikter/debatt/article3854541.ece) that they want to investigate this further. Several professors from Uppsala reply (http://www.nyteknik.se/asikter/debatt/article3854985.ece) that the whole thing is likely a scam, and that Elforsk shouldn't be taken in. Thanks to reader HL in the comments section, who notes that Google Translate does pretty well with Swedish-English.
