Zafgen's Epoxide Pays Its Way
25 Jun 2014

I've written here before about Zafgen, a small startup targeting obesity therapy with an unusual (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/10/17/zafgens_epoxide_adventure) covalent epoxide drug candidate. Last fall (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/11/15/zafgens_epoxide_clears_a_hurdle) they cleared Phase II, and now they're going public. 
 Bruce Booth, whose firm has been the VC muscle behind the company, has an overview of how things have worked here (http://lifescivc.com/2014/06/zafgen-supersizes-its-obesity-focused-ipo-an-early-investors-reflections/) . It's a good read for anyone interested in where small drug companies come from and what they have to be able to do to be able to survive. Many of the readers here will be familiar with the scientific part of this kind of story (as am I), but the financial and managerial parts have to be handled right, too, and mistakes with any of them can sink the whole effort. 
 I'll bet that if you'd asked Bruce or his partners back in 2006 for the odds, "Nice big IPO" would have been pretty far down their list of possibilities for the company, even if you'd stipulated success for their drug candidate. MetAP2 (the compound's target, which is something they didn't realize back then) is an interesting enzyme, and obesity has always been an interesting field (although not always in a good way). And on the scientific end, I'm most interested to see how that compound fares as it goes on through Phase III. It's a structure that a lot of us would have crossed off the list about three seconds after seeing it, and anything that extends the bounds of what's feasible in drug discovery is worth keeping an eye on. We very much need for more things to be possible.
