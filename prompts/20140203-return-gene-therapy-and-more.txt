The Return of Gene Therapy (And More)
3 Feb 2014

The advent (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/09/05/crispr_takes_off) of such techniques as CRISPR (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR) has people thinking again about gene therapy, and no wonder. This has always been a dream of molecular medicine - you could wipe all sorts of rare diseases off the board by going in and fixing their known genetic defects. Actually doing that, though, has been extremely difficult (and dangerous, since patients have died (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Gelsinger) in the attempt). 
 But here's a report (http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674%2814%2900079-8) of embryonic gene modification in cynomologous monkeys, and if it works in cynos, it's very likely indeed to work in humans. In vitro fertilization plus CRISPR/Cas9 - neither of these, for better or worse, are all that hard to do, and my guess is that we're very close to seeing someone try this - probably not in the US at first, but there are plenty of other jurisdictions. There's a somewhat disturbing angle, though: I don't see much cause (or humanly acceptable cause) for generating gene-knockout human beings, which is what this technique would most easily provide. And for fixing genetic defects, well, you'd have to know that the single-cell embryo actually has the defect, and unless both parents are homozygous, you're not going to be sure (can't sequence the only cell you have, can you?) So the next easiest thing is to add copies of some gene you find desirable, and that will take us quickly into uneasy territory. 
 A less disturbing route might be to see if the technique can be used to gene-edit the egg and sperm cells before fertilization. Then you've got the possibility of editing germ cell lines in vivo , which really would wipe these diseases out of humanity (except for random mutations), but that will be another one of those hold-your-breath steps, I'd think. It's only a short step from fixing what's wrong to enhancing what's already there - it all depends on where you slide the scale to define "wrong". More fast-twitch muscle fibers, maybe? Restore the ability to make your own vitamin C? Switch the kid's lipoproteins to ApoA1 Milano (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ApoA-1_Milano) ? 
 For a real look into the future, combine this with last week's (http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature12968) startling report (http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature12969) of the generation of stem cells (http://www.nature.com/news/acid-bath-offers-easy-path-to-stem-cells-1.14600) by applying stress to normal tissue samples. This work seems quite solid, and there are apparently anecdotal reports (see the end of this transcript (http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=268171016) ) of some of it being reproduced already. If so, we would appear to be vaulting into a new world of tissue engineering, or at least a new world of being able to find out what's really hard about tissue engineering. ("Just think - horrible, head-scratching experimental tangles that were previously beyond our reach can finally be. . .") 
 Now have a look at this news (http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2013/11/25/three-vcs-pour-43m-editas-edit-genetic-disorders/?utm_source=feedly) about a startup called Editas. They're not saying what techniques they're going to use (my guess is some proprietary variant of CRISPR). But whatever they have, they're going for the brass ring: 
 (Editas has) ambitious plans to create an entirely new class of drugs based on what it calls “gene editing.” The idea is similar, yet different, from gene therapy: Editas’ goal is to essentially target disorders caused by a singular genetic defect, and using a proprietary in-house technology, create a drug that can “edit” out the abnormality so that it becomes a normal, functional gene—potentially, in a single treatment. . . 
 . . .Editas, in theory, could use this system to create a drug that could cure any number of genetic diseases via a one-time fix, and be more flexible than gene therapy or other techniques used to cure a disease on the genetic level. But even so, the challenges, just like gene therapy, are significant. Editas has to figure out a way to safely and effectively deliver a gene-editing drug into the body, something Bitterman acknowledges is one of the big hills the company has to climb. 
 This is all very exciting stuff. But personally, I don't do gene editing, being an organic chemist and a small-molecule therapeutics guy. So what does all this progress mean for someone like me (or for the companies that employ people like me?) Well, for one thing, it is foretelling the eventual doom of the what we can call the Genzyme model, treating rare metabolic disorders with few patients but high cost-per-patient. A lot of companies are targeting (or trying to target) that space these days, and no wonder. Their business model is still going to be safe for some years, but honestly, I'd have to think that eventually someone is going to get this gene-editing thing to work. You'd have to assume that it will be harder than it looks; most everything is harder than it looks. And regulatory agencies are not going to be at their speediest when it comes to setting up trials for this kind of thing. But a lot of people with a lot of intelligence, a lot of persistence, and an awful lot of money are going after this, and I have to think that someone is going to succeed. Gene editing, Moderna (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderna_Therapeutics) 's mRNA work - we're going to rewrite the genome to suit ourselves, and sooner than later. The reward will be treatments that previous eras would have had to ascribe to divine intervention, a huge step forward in Francis Bacon's program of "the effecting of all things possible". 
 The result will also be a lot of Schumpeterian "creative destruction" as some existing business models dissolve. And that's fine - I think that business models should always be subject to that selection pressure. As a minor side benefit, these therapies might finally (but probably won't) shut up the legion of people who go on about how drug companies aren't interested in cures, just endlessly profitable treatments. It never seems to occur to them that cures are hard, nor that someone might actually come along with one.
