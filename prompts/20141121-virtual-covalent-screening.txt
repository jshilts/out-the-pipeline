Virtual Covalent Screening
21 Nov 2014

Covalent drugs have been a big item in R&D over the last few years (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/02/10/the_infinitely_active_impurity) , and I wrote here (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/05/30/covalent_fragments) about covalent fragments. The whole topic of reactive groups in small molecules and their interaction with living systems and biomolecules is a complicated one (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/09/08/reactive_groups_still_not_so_reactive) , with many interesting twists. 
 Now the Shoichet group at UCSF has what could be a useful computational approach to the field. They're reporting (http://www.nature.com/nchembio/journal/v10/n12/full/nchembio.1666.html) "DOCKovalent", a virtual screening platform for covalent inhibitors, and illustrate it with examples of cyanoacrylamides and boronic acids across several different enzymes. The calculations are based on the angles needed for an electrophile to react with a residue like cysteine - these reactions, as organic chemists know, can be rather constrained in what approaches the reacting partners have to take. In solution you can see stereoelectronic effects that arise from the structures of the small molecules, but most reactions can find a way. When this process is taking place in the clefts of a protein, though, the number of feasible approaches can get cut down considerably. I'm generally pretty hard to convince when it comes to virtual screening, but the number of constraints needed here gives me more hope than usual for meaningful results. 
 Running their program retrospectively, with known covalent inhibitors of various enzymes versus decoy molecules, showed that the virtual screening did (in most cases) give hit sets that were well enriched in the real binders. Like any such technique, it's going to fail sometimes, both on individual compounds and on whole runs, but the Shoichet group has made the tool available on the web for anyone to try for free. Here's the link (http://covalent.docking.org/) , and I applaud them for putting it out there. The appeal of computational approaches has always been the low barrier to entry, and this lowers it even more. That's the hazard of computational approaches, too, of course, but the results from a virtual screen like this should at least be easy to subject to a real-world test.
