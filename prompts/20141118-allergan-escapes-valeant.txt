Allergan Escapes Valeant
18 Nov 2014

The Allergan / Valeant (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/07/21/allergan_twists_and_turns) saga has come to an end (http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/17/us-allergan-actavis-idUSKCN0J00W720141117) , with Allergan fighting them off by doing a deal to be taken over by Actavis. No word yet on whether they'are going to let Allergan keep the invisible golf course (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/05/02/allergan_golfcourse_deprived) . 
 Valeant is, of course, famously tight-fisted (which is why Allergan had no desire to be taken over by them), and the Actavis price was about six billion dollars higher than what Valeant said that they were willing to pay. One wonders if all six billion dollars were necessary to get them to go away, but Activis must have run their own numbers. If the deal turns out to be a success, it might cause people to look with suspicion on any future Valeant bids for other companies, though. 
 That Reuters story says that the combined companies expect to have an R&D budget of $1.7 billion. Allergan's current spending is around 1 billion (and falling), and Actavis' was 0.62 billion before its most recent acquisition, so we may have another M&A case of one plus one equaling about 1.8. Still, if it had been Valeant, one plus one would have equaled about 1.04, so there is that. Actavis does spend less (http://fortune.com/2014/11/17/allergan-actavis-valeant/) on R&D as a percentage than Allergan does, though, so there is that.
