This Took Fourteen Months
7 Nov 2014

Readers will remember the "nanorod paper" controversy from last year - two papers were published from the Pease group at Utah on the fabrication of a type of nanostructure, but the images therein were pretty clearly fabricated (http://chemjobber.blogspot.com/2013/08/does-this-picture-look-weird.html) themselves, especially the paper in Nano Letters . That one looked like it had been done by a fourth-grader using Microsoft Paint. Here's a post (http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2013/08/13/alleged-data-manipulation-in-nano-letters-and-acs-nano-from-the-pease-group/) that brought these to wider attention. One of the papers was withdrawn fairly quickly, but not before the editors of ACS Nano had told everyone (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/10/22/acsnano_on_problematic_papers) to run along and not to be so nasty. My take on that is the same it's always been: if you don't want your work commented on and criticized by all comers, on whatever grounds and under whatever names they like, then don't publish it. Once you do, though, those invitations have been sent out, and it was ever so for authors of all kinds. Sad? Maybe. True? Oh, yeah. 
 It's taken a while, but the ACS Nano paper has now been withdrawn (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn5053052) as well. Retraction Watch now brings word (http://www.retractionwatch.com/2014/11/06/university-of-utah-investigation-fingers-chemistry-grad-student-for-misconduct/) of the sequel to all this, the investigation at Utah. 
 Ultimately, the school pinned the blame on graduate student Rajasekhar Anumolu and exonerated principal investigator Leonard F. Pease. Botkin also told us the investigation found that no federal money had been used in the experiments, despite notes on the two papers indicating otherwise. . . 
 [From Jeffrey Botkin, research integrity officer at the Univeristy of Utah}: 
 "The investigation determined that all of the images in the Nano Letters paper were fabricated and, therefore, none of the data were valid. 
 The supplemental figure S2c in the ACSNano paper was the only manipulated image identified in that paper. The manipulation consisted of a cut and past ³patch² over two relatively small areas of the image. These manipulations represent data falsification. For the ACSNano publication, the Investigation Committee could not determine a rationale for the image manipulation as the ³patches² did not appear to cover significant data elements in the image. 
 Mr. Anumolu, a graduate student in Chemical Engineering, was, by all accounts, primarily responsible for data acquisition and manuscript preparation for the Nano Letters publication and for Figure S2c in the ACSNano publication. The Investigation Committee determined that Mr. Anumolu was responsible for the image manipulations and was guilty of research misconduct. The other authors were found not guilty of research misconduct. Mr. Anumolu was not awarded his degree and is no longer affiliated with the University of Utah. Both papers have been retracted." 
 I can well believe that the grad student was at fault here, but it's worth remembering that Mr. Anomalous worked for Professor Pease, who is supposed to be looking over the manuscripts that go out with his name on them. (Mind you, the referees at the two journals are supposed to be looking at them, too, so there's that). But Prof. Pease also at the time apparently threatened legal action against Chemistry Blog for calling attention to the story. (The legal threat is no longer mentioned in that post, but was noted by Chembark (http://blog.chembark.com/2013/08/14/some-very-suspicious-tem-images-in-nano-letters/) at the time). He also asked that nothing be written until the University of Utah had finished their investigation, and we now see how long it look the wheels to turn in that case. 
 No, while there's room for abuse in the post-publication-commentary world, there's been a lot of abuse of the scientific publication process already - from the authors . And sometimes from their institutions, and from some of the publishers as well. Too many of the complaints from those parties about these situations seem to amount to "Please refrain from making unfavorable comments on my paper where people can see them", or perhaps "Please refrain from making unfavorable comments on this paper that we are charging the scientific community to read". As far as I know, every paper that's created a big post-publication fuss about its validity has been withdrawn, with a few cases of substantial revision and survival.
