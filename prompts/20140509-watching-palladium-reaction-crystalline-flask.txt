In this case, they soak a palladium complex into the crystal, and they're apparently able to see (over a period of hours) changes in the electron density as a halogenation reaction proceeds. 
 You don't see much time-lapse X-ray work. Even seeing the starting palladium complex is a feat, since in solution it doesn't hang around very long at all (in this case, it tends to lose its acetonitrile ligand and go on to dimerize). The fleeting intermediates in this crystalline state aren't going to show up, either, since they're going to make such tiny impacts on the electron density map, but you can see the main species as they shift. I'm pretty sure that I buy their interpretation of the data, but I'd be glad to hear from X-ray folks with other views. 
 You'll note that the starting sulfur-complexed Pd species is a bit odd - you don't see many sulfur-complexed palladium complexes like this in organic synthesis. The reason emerges as you read the text closely. They started out with Pd(acac)2, but had to replace that ligand with the xanthate, because otherwise they got ligand exchange with the zinc iodide parts of the metal-organic framework (which I can well believe). And after that, a solvent exchange was needed, soaking out the nitrobenzene from the original crystal formation and replacing it with acetonitrile. 
 I find that part very interesting indeed. That's because I've done some personal follow-up in this area (as many readers will have guessed), and I can tell you that in my hands, exposing uncomplexed crystals of this metal-organic framework to acetonitrile (or any polar solvent, for that matter) leads to their rapid decomposition. Having the pores filled with a guest, as in this case, apparently gives very different results, as well it might. 
 The paper calls this a "crystalline flask", and we are going to need some sort of new nomenclature to describe this state. It's certainly not the solution phase (far from it), but it's not the crystalline phase as we usually think of it, either. Studying reactions this way comes with the same sorts of footnotes as any other phase, though (solution versus gas versus solid): the energies of the participating species can be (and surely are) influenced by the medium. So their geometries and the resulting product distributions need to be interpreted with that in mind, but there's still a lot to be learned.
