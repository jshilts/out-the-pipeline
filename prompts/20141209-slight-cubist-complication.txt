A Slight Cubist Complication
9 Dec 2014

This probably isn't quite as embarrassing as it looks: the very day of Merck's bid for Cubist Pharmaceuticals, the company loses a patent case (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-12-09/cubist-barred-from-blocking-generic-cubicin-beyond-2016.html) for protection of its flagship drug. Cubicin (daptomycin) is by far the main source of revenue at the company right now ($800 million last year, and continuing to climb), and as one might imagine, the generic companies would like some of that action as soon as possible. That's what the present case is about: four patents that take the drug's protection out to 2019 or 2020. 
 These were invalidated by a district court in Delaware, on the grounds that they do not actually represent new inventions. So as it stands, Hospira could take Cubicin generic in 2016. This can't be welcome news to Merck, since those extra years of revenue would go a long way towards paying off the entire cost of the acquisition. But the risk was known - in fact, the offer specifically states that an unfavorable decision in the case would not be a material event and would not derail things. It'll be appealed, for one thing, and enough legal skill will surely be applied to grind the gears past that 2016 date, no matter what the final decision is. You can't always count on a big drug company to be able to discover the drugs it needs (nor a small one, for that matter), but big companies tend to be pretty good at maximizing the revenues that they already have. 
 The other part of the deal is that Cubist has other antibiotics in development, which you can count on Merck also making the most out of. The main way that things can fall apart is if there's a combination of lost Cubicin revenue and some clinical failures among these new drugs. Embarrassment still awaits, as it does, potentially, for all of us in the business. 
 Update: not everyone agrees with this take, with some in the comments section citing this as a major Merck mistake.
