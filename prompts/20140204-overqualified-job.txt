Overqualified For the Job
4 Feb 2014

Here's an uncomfortable (but necessary) topic in the chemistry job market: a reader tells me that his company's search for someone with 2 to 5 years experience brought in (as you might expect) a flood of applications from people with much more than that (10 to 15 years). The problem is, the job (as it stands) isn't going to use most of the skills and knowledge that they've built up. It's a junior position, and they're not junior to anyone. 
 So here are the questions: is it OK to even apply for positions in this way? Is it (on the other end) appropriate to offer someone a "downgraded" position like this? Can it even work out if you do, or will the person taking the job not be able to fit into that role? 
 I'm not sure I have any good answers. My guess is that most people would have trouble fitting in this way, and that the situation would eventually result in a lot of discomfort on both sides. But on the other hand, a job is a job, and there aren't too many of them out there. On the gripping hand, though, (old science fiction reference there), less-experienced people need jobs, too, and shouldn't they be able to compete for the ones that they're best qualified for? 
 I've seen a variant of this situation, one that I most certainly do not recommend. At a company I know of, a person was hired into a Master's level position, and did fine. They eventually revealed, though, that they had had a PhD all along, and applied for a vacant position at that level. This strategy got them fired, though, for having lied on their original application (the company's position, which I can understand, was that if they didn't fire someone for this, how could they fire the next person who lied about something else?) In the end, people found this person a job at another smaller company in the area, so the exit wasn't as hard as it could have been, but it was still a mess. 
 But the questions above don't apply to stealth resumés - these are people who are being completely open about their overqualifications. So what to do?
