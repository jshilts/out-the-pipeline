A New Book on Scaffold Hopping
22 Jan 2014

I've been sent a copy of Scaffold Hopping in Medicinal Chemistry (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3527333649/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=3527333649&linkCode=as2&tag=lagniappe-20) , a new volume from Wiley, edited by Nathan Brown of the Institute of Cancer Research in London. There are eighteen chapters - five on identifying and characterizing scaffolds to start with, ten on various computational approaches to scaffold-hopping, and three case histories. 
 One of the things you realize quickly when you starting thinking about (or reading about) that topic is that scaffolds are in the eye of the beholder, and that's what those first chapters are trying to come to grips with. Figuring out the "maximum common substructure" of a large group of analogs, for example, is not an easy problem at all, certainly not by eyeballing, and not through computational means, either (it's not solvable in polynomial time (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity) , if we want to get formal about it). One chemist will look at a pile of compounds and say "Oh yeah, the isoxazoles from Project XYZ", while someone who hasn't seen them before might say "Hmm, a bunch of amide heterocycles" or "A bunch of heterobiaryls" or what have you. 
 Another big question is how far you have to move in order to qualify as having hopped to another scaffold. My own preference is strictly empirical: if you've made a change that would be big enough to make most people draw a new Markush structure compared to your current series, you've scaffold-hopped. Ideally, you've kept the activity at your primary target, but changed it in the counterscreens or changed the ADMET properties. That's not to say that all these changes are going to be beneficial - people try this sort of thing all the time and wipe out the primary activity, or pick up even more clearance or hERG than the original series had. But those are the breaks. 
 And those are the main reasons that people do this sort of thing: to work out of a patent corner, to fix selectivity, or to get better properties. The appeal is that you might be able to address these without jettisoning everything you learned about the SAR of the previous compounds. If this is a topic of interest, especially from the computational angles, this book is certainly worth a look.
