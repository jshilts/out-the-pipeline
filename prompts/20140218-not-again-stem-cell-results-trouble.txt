Not Again - Stem Cell Results in Trouble?
18 Feb 2014

Oh, @#$!. That was my first comment when I saw this story. (http://www.nature.com/news/acid-bath-stem-cell-study-under-investigation-1.14738) That extraordinary recent work on creating stem cells by subjected normal cells to acid stress is being investigated: 
 The RIKEN centre in Kobe announced on Friday that it is looking into alleged irregularities in the work of biologist Haruko Obokata, who works at the institution. She shot to fame last month as the lead author on two papers published in Nature that demonstrated a simple way to reprogram mature mice cells into an embryonic state by simply applying stress, such as exposure to acid or physical pressure on cell membranes. The RIKEN investigation follows allegations on blog sites about the use of duplicated images in Obokata’s papers, and numerous failed attempts to replicate her results. 
 PubPeer (https://pubpeer.com/publications/8B755710BADFE6FB0A848A44B70F7D) gets the credit for bringing some of the problems into the light. There are some real problems with figures in the two papers, as well as earlier ones from the same authors. These might be explicable as cimple mistakes, which is what the authors seem to be claiming, if it weren't for the fact that no one (http://www.ipscell.com/stap-new-data/) seems to be able to get the stem-cell results to reproduce. There are mitigating factors there, too - different cell lines, perhaps the lack of a truly detailed protocol from the original paper. But a paper should have enough details in it to be reproduced, shouldn't it? 
 Someone on Twitter was trying to tell me the other day that the whole reproducibility issue was being blown out of proportion. I don't think so. The one thing we seem to be able to reproduce is trouble. 
 Update: a list of the weirdest things (http://www.ipscell.com/2014/02/top-10-oddest-things-about-the-unfolding-stap-stem-cell-story/) (so far) about this whole business.
