More Fukuyama Corrections
3 Apr 2014

The Fukuyama group has another series of corrections out, this time in JACS. Here's one (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja502534m) , and the other follow right behind it in the ASAP queue. This adds to the string of them (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/02/04/put_down_that_whiteout_drop_that_photoshop_cursor) in Organic Letters . It's more whiteout stuff - vanishing solvent peaks and impurities. These presumably don't affect the conclusions of the paper, but they don't make a person any more confident, either. One hopes that these high-profile cases will shake people up. . .
