Fatalities at DuPont
17 Nov 2014

As many readers will have heard, there was a fatal accident at a DuPont plant in the Houston area over the weekend. Four workers were killed by methyl mercaptan (methanethiol), and here's more (http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/DuPont-plant-workers-died-rushing-to-help-5897558.php) on what happened. As is often the case, there were fatalities at the site of the leak, and more from those first trying to help. 
 Methanethiol itself is certainly toxic, although its powerful smell (which apparently reached 40 miles downwind of this accident) usually keeps anyone away from harmful concentrations of it. In the concentrations experienced next to a major leak, though, differences in toxicity for such gases are almost besides the point: just about anything can be deadly. 
 It'll be some time before anyone finds out just what went wrong at the La Porte plant. A large chemical operation has plenty of inherent hazards; the question is whether these deaths could have been prevented, and how. One's first assumption is that they could have been, and that this did not have to happen this way, but we'll see what the investigation reveals. One detail that Houston Chronicle story notes is the lack of protective equipment (two of the employees killed appear to have come into the area without masks after responding to the first employee's call for help). I would have to think that the only thing that would keep a person alive in such circumstances would be a full-face mask with its own oxygen supply. I don't know if that's what the last responder, who did have a mask, was carrying. That sort of equipment takes more time to put on than any sort of filter mask, but no filtration system alone would save someone from a room filling with methyl mercaptan, either. 
 So in memory of these four, here's something that all of us who work in the lab can do today. Take a look around you. Remind yourself of where the fire extinguishers are (and there should be more than one kind). Think of how you'd get to the safety shower if you had to use it. And pick the door you'll use if a situation get beyond that. It's far easier to go over such details when things are quiet, and if you do that every so often you'll have a much better chance of remembering where to go when you really need to. 
 And whenever you're setting up an experiment that involve any noticeable hazard (pyrophoric reagent, toxic liquid or gas, potential exotherm), think for a moment about what might be most likely to go wrong, and also what the worst thing that could happen might be , and what you'd do about them. Is it dropping that bottle of phosgene solution on the floor? A fire started by your hydrogenation catalyst or your sodium hydride? An exotherm that sends your reaction pouring out over the hot plate or heating mantle? Picturing these things beforehand is never wasted time, because (as everyone with experience in the lab knows) such things do happen, and not on anyone's schedule. Those four DuPont workers were getting ready to go home for the day when suddenly everything went wrong: in their memory, keep an eye out for what might go wrong in your own fume hood.
