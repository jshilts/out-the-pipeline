Prison Sentences in the GSK China Scandal
19 Sep 2014

The GSK/China bribery case has come to some sort of ending (http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/11548536) . The company has been fined the equivalent of nearly $500 million, and Mark Reilly, the former head of that part of their operations in China, has been sentenced to prison for "two to four years". No further details seem to be available about the sentence. There are so few particulars, in fact, that although several other people are reported to have also been sentenced, we don't know who they are or what prison terms they've received. China's press (and government, same difference) are working on the usual need-to-know basis, and they've decided that no one else needs to know. 
 Update: the l atest report (http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/19/glaxosmithkline-china-mark-reilly-deported-uk-guilty-bribery-hunan) is that Reilly has been given a suspended sentence and has been deported back to the UK. Certainly beats time in the Chinese prison system.
