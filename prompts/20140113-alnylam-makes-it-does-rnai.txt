Alnylam Makes It (As Does RNAi?)
13 Jan 2014

I've written about (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2011/08/02/merck_rnai_alnylam_and_so_on) Alnylam, one of the flagship RNA interference companies, a few times around here. A couple of years ago (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/01/20/alnylam_cuts_back_hard) , I was wondering if they'd win the race to come up with results that would keep the doors open. 
 Well, if you haven't been keeping up with the news in this space, they made it (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-13/sanofi-pays-700-million-for-alnylam-drugs-and-12-percent-stake.html) . Sanofi has just bought a large stake in the company, on the strength of the recent clinical results (http://www.alnylam.com/capella/presentations/positive-phase-ii-data-patisiran-isfap/) with patisiran, an RNAi therapy for the rare disease transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis ( ATTR (http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/335301-overview) ). Alnylam has a l ot on their schedule (http://www.alnylam.com/product-pipeline/alnylam-5x15/) these days, and the Sanofi deal will provide a big boost towards getting clinical data on all these ideas. Congratulations to them, and to RNAi in general, which has had a lengthy (and often overhyped) growth phase, and now might be starting to realize its promise.
