What If?
2 Sep 2014

I wanted to let readers know of a fun new book that's out this week. Randall Munroe, of webcomic XKCD (http://xkcd.com) fame, has written What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IYUYF4A/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00IYUYF4A&linkCode=as2&tag=lagniappe-20&linkId=HESI76FNXJADVJJC) . There are a lot of truly odd ones in there, and he takes them on as best he can. I'm glad to say that I'm quoted in the chapter on "What would happen if you made a periodic table of cube-shaped bricks, where each brick was made of the corresponding element?" (That should give you an idea of the sorts of questions that come in to him; it makes my mail look fairly sane by comparison). And no, you wouldn't want to do that one - consider astatine and francium, for starters.
