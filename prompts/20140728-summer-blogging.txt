Summer Blogging
28 Jul 2014

I wanted to let everyone know that blogging will be irregular around here for the next week or so. I'll be taking some time off here and there, and while I'll surely get a few blog posts in, they won't show up at the usual times. (I started the whole time-off process over the weekend, with a trip to Stellafane (http://stellafane.org) , the big amateur astronomy gathering up in Vermont. Despite earlier weather forecasts, Saturday night was clear and dark, the best night skies I've seen in years. My wife and kids joined me (their first star party), and as we were getting pulled pork sandwiches from the food tent, my son looked around and said "Wow, there sure are a lot of barbecue-eating, telescope-owning guys with beards around here. You fit right in!"
