Clinical Trial Fraud
10 Sep 2014

Bizarre news from Evotec - see what you make of this press release (http://www.evotec.com/article/en/Press-releases/Evotec-announces-update-on-DiaPep277/2653) : 
 Evotec AG was informed that US company Hyperion Therapeutics, Inc. ("Hyperion") is terminating the development of DiaPep277(R) for newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetes. 
 In a press release published by Hyperion on 08 September 2014 at market opening in the US, the company states that it has uncovered evidence that certain employees of Andromeda Biotech, Ltd. ("Andromeda"), which Hyperion acquired in June 2014, engaged in serious misconduct, involved with the trial data of DiaPep277. Hyperion announced that it will complete the DIA-AID 2 Phase 3 trial, but will terminate further development in DiaPep277. 
 Here's the Hyperion press release (http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-1412CE/3456824468x0x780301/9f921f5e-b0f5-44d5-a9de-8b77356754ff/HPTX_News_2014_9_8_General_Releases.pdf) , and it details a terrible mess: 
 The company has uncovered evidence that certain employees of Andromeda Biotech, Ltd., which Hyperion acquired in June 2014, engaged in serious misconduct, including collusion with a third-party biostatistics firm in Israel to improperly receive un-blinded DIA-AID 1 trial data and to use such data in order to manipulate the analyses to obtain a favorable result. Additional evidence indicates that the biostatistics firm and certain Andromeda employees continued the improper practice of sharing and examining un-blinded data from the ongoing DIA-AID 2 trial. All of these acts were concealed from Hyperion and others. 
 The Company has suspended the Andromeda employees known to be involved, is notifying relevant regulatory authorities, and continues to investigate in order to explore its legal options. Hyperion employees were not involved in any of the improper conduct. 
 What a nightmare. All biomedical data are vulnerable to outright fraud, and it gives a person the shivers just thinking about it. I can only imagine the reactions of Hyperion's management when they heard about this, and Evotec's when Hyperion told them about it. What, exactly, the Andromeda people (and the third-party biostatistics people) thought they were getting out of this is an interesting question, too - did they hope to profit if the company announced positive results? That's my best guess, but I'm not sleazy enough (I hope) to think these things through properly.
