Sanofi Beats the Drum
20 Nov 2014

We saw AstraZeneca talking about (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/11/19/astrazeneca_how_many_approvals_again) its upcoming onslaught of drug approvals the other day, and not to be outdone, Sanofi is doing the same (http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/20/sanofi-sa-medicines-idUSL6N0TA0FU20141120) . Actually, they're seeing AstraZeneca's puny bet and raising them: Sanofi says that they could have "up to six" approvals next year alone, and as many as 18 by the end of 2020. 
 An average of three new drugs a year for six years in a row? I hope they can do it, but it's never been done. Not even close. I sort of wish that companies, when they started talking like this, would just go for it, and say something like "We plan an absolutely unprecedented , record-shattering burst of productivity. Grovel before us, puny humans!" 
 The biggest surge that I know of is GlaxoSmithKline's recent run: five approvals (one of them a vaccine) in 2013. They've had one new molecule approved earlier this year as well. So with that impressive performance, they're averaging out to what Sanofi is proposing to do for a six-year stretch. That will be very good news if they manage it, both for patients and (obviously) for Sanofi. But when companies start talking like this, they seem to attract lightning bolts (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/12/18/lillys_twodrugsayear_prediction) . 
 One last thing to note is that if Sanofi really is headed for a surge in drug productivity, how much of that, do you think, happened on ex-CEO Chris Viehbacher's watch? The board just ousted him, and here they are a couple of weeks later talking about how great things are going. . .
