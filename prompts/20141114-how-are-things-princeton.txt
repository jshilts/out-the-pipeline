How Are Things at Princeton?
14 Nov 2014

So how's the new chemistry building at Princeton working out? I last asked for comments four years ago (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2010/10/11/princetons_new_chemistry_building) , but I'm prompted to do so again by this post (http://luysii.wordpress.com/2014/11/13/its-why-i-dont-read-novels/) by Luysii, who has been hearing that the building isn't necessarily working out as planned. Can anyone comment? To a first approximation, a lot of buildings don't work out quite as planned, but I'm always interested in hearing about how the glassy high-interaction high-innovation designs are performing in the real world.
