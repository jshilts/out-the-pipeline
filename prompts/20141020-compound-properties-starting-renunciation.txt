Compound Properties: Starting a Renunciation
20 Oct 2014

I've been thinking a lot recently about compound properties, and what we use them for. My own opinions on this subject have been changing over the years, and I'm interested to see if I have any company on this. 
 First off, why do we measure things like cLogP, polar surface area, aromatic ring count, and all the others? A quick (and not totally inaccurate) answer is "because we can", but what are we trying to accomplish? Well, we're trying to read the future a bit and decrease the horrendous failure rates for drug candidates, of course. And the two aspects that compound properties are supposed to help with are PK and tox. 
 Of the two, pharmacokinetics is the one with the better shot at relevance. But how fine-grained can we be with our measurements? I don't think it's controversial to say that compounds with really high cLogP values are going to have, on average, more difficult PK, for various reasons. Compounds with lots of aromatic rings in them are, on average, going to have more difficult PK, too. But how much is "lots" or "really high"? That's the problem, because I don't think that you can draw a useful line and say that things on one side of it are mostly fine, and things on the other are mostly not. There's too much overlap, and too many exceptions. The best you can hope for, if you're into line-drawing, is to draw one up pretty far into the possible range and say that things below it may or may not be OK, but things above it have a greater chance of being bad. (This, to my mind, is all that we mean by all the "Rule of 5" stuff). But what good does that do? Everyone doing drug discovery already knows that much, or should. Where we get into trouble is when we treat these lines as if they were made of electrified barbed wire. 
 That's because of a larger problem with metrics aimed at PK: PK is relatively easy data to get. When in doubt, you should just dose the compound and find out. This makes predicting PK problems a lower-value proposition - the real killer application would be predicting toxicology problems (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/06/12/predicting_toxicology) . I fear that over the years many rule-of-five zealots have confused these two fields, out of a natural hope that something can be done about the latter (or perhaps out of thinking that the two are more related than they really are). That's unfortunate, because to my mind, this is where compound property metrics get even less useful. That recent AstraZeneca paper (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/10/02/we_cant_calculate_our_way_out_of_this_one) has had me thinking, the one where they state that they can't reproduce the trends reported by Pfizer's group on the influences of compound properties. If you really can take two reasonably-sized sets of drug discovery data and come to opposite conclusions about this issue, what hope does this approach have? 
 Toxicology is just too complicated, I think, for us to expect that any simple property metrics can tell us enough to be useful. That's really annoying, because we could all really use something like that. But increasingly, I think we're still on our own, where we've always been, and that we're just trying to make ourselves feel better when we think otherwise. That problem is particularly acute as you go up the management ladder. Avoiding painful tox-driven failures is such a desirable goal that people are tempted to reach for just about anything reasonable-sounding that holds out hope for it. And this one (compound property space policing) has many other tempting advantages - it's cheap to implement, easy to measure, and produces piles of numbers (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/08/22/too_many_metrics) that make for data-rich presentations. Even the managers who don't really know much chemistry can grasp the ideas behind it. How can it not be a good thing? 
 Especially when the alternative is so, so. . .empirical. So case-by-case. So disappointingly back-to-where-we-started. I mean, getting up in front of the higher-ups and telling them that no, we're not doing ourselves much good by whacking people about aromatic ring counts and nitrogen atom counts and PSA counts, etc., that we're just going to have to take the compounds forward and wait and see like we always have. . .that doesn't sound like much fun, does it? This isn't what anyone is wanting to hear. You're going to do a lot better if you can tell people that you've Identified The Problem, and How to Address It, and that this strategy is being implemented right now, and here are the numbers to prove it. Saying, in effect, that we can't do anything about it runs the risk of finding yourself replaced by someone who will say that we can. 
 But all that said, I really am losing faith in property-space metrics as a way to address toxicology. The only thing I'm holding on to are some of the structure-based criteria. I really do, for example, think that quinones are bad news. I think if you advance a hundred quinones into the clinic, that a far higher percentage of them will fail due to tox and side effects than a hundred broadly similar non-quinones. Same goes for rhodanines, and a few other classes, those "aces in the PAINS deck" I referred to the other day. I'm still less doctrinaire about functional groups than I used to be, but I still have a few that I balk at. 
 And yes, I know that there are drugs with all these groups in them. But if you look at the quinones, for example, you find mostly cytotoxics and anti-infectives which are cytotoxins with some selectivity for non-mammalian cells. If you're aiming at a particularly nasty target (resistant malaria, pancreatic cancer), go ahead and pull out all the stops. But I don't think anyone should cheerfully plow ahead with such structures unless there are such mitigating circumstances, or at least not without realizing the risks that they're taking on. 
 But this doesn't do us much good, either - most medicinal chemists don't want to advance such compounds anyway. In fact, rather than being too permissive about things like quinones, most of us are probably too conservative about the sorts of structures we're willing to deal with. There are a lot of funny-looking drugs out there, as it never hurts to remind oneself. Peeling off the outer fringe of these (and quinones are indeed the outer fringe) isn't going to increase anyone's success rate much. So what to do? 
 I don't have a good answer for that one. I wish I did. It's a rare case when we can say, just by looking at its structure, that a particular compound just won't work. I've been hoping that the percentages would allow us to say more than that about more compounds. But I'm really not sure that they do, at least not to the extent that we need them to, and I worry that we're kidding ourselves when we pretend otherwise.
