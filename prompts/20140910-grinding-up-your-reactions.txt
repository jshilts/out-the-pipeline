Grinding Up Your Reactions
10 Sep 2014

I'd seen various solventless reactions between solid-phase components over the years, but never tried one until now. And I have to say, I'm surprised and impressed. I can't quite say which literature reference I'm following, unfortunately, because it might conceivably give someone a lead on what I'm making at the moment, but it's a reference that I found as a new technique for an old reaction. Doing it in solution gives you a mess, but just grinding up the two solid reactants and the reagent, in a mortar and pestle, gives you a very clean conversion. The stuff turns into a sort of ugly clay inside the mortar, but it looks are deceiving. I feel like an alchemist. Consider me a convert to the solventless lifestyle - I'll try this again on some other reaction classes when I get the chance. Anyone else ever ground up some solids and made a new product?
