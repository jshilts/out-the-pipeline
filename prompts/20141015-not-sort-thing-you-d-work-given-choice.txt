It discusses inhibitors of SETD8 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/387893) , an unusual epigenetic enzyme that is the only known methyltransferase to target (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1151662/) lysine 20 of histone H4. Inhibitors of it would help to unravel just what functions that has, presumably several that no other pathway is quite handling. But finding decent methyltransferase inhibitors has not been easy. 

When you search for them, actually, you find compounds like the ones in this paper. Most medicinal chemists will look at these, say the word "quinone", perhaps take a moment spit on the floor or add a rude adjective, and move on to see if there's anything better to look at. Quinones are that unpopular, and with good reason. They're redox-active, can pick up nucleophiles as Michael acceptors, react with amines - they have a whole suite of unattractive behaviors. And that explains their profile in cells and whole animals, with a range of toxic, carcinogenic, and immunologic liabilities. A lot of very active natural products have a quinone in them - it's a real warhead. No medicinal chemist with any experience would feel good about trying to advance one as a lead compound, and (for the same reasons) they tend to make poor tool compounds as well. You just don't know what else they're hitting, and the chance of them hitting something else are too high. 
 The authors of this paper, though, have a higher tolerance: 

In the present work, we characterize these compounds and demonstrate that NSC663284, BVT948, and ryuvidine (3 out of the 4 HTS hits) inhibit SETD8 via different modes. NSC663284 (SPS8I1), ryuvidine (SPS8I2), and BVT948 (SPS8I3) efficiently and selectively suppress cellular H4K20me1 at doses lower than 5 μM within 24 h. . . The cells treated with SPS8I1−3 (Small-molecule Pool of SETD8 Inhibitor) recapitulate cell-cycle-arrest phenotypes similar to what were reported for knocking down SETD8 by RNAi. Given that the three compounds have distinct structures and inhibit SETD8 in different manners, they can be employed collectively as chemical genetic tools to interrogate SETD8-involved methylation. 
 I would be very careful about doing that, myself. I don't find those structures as distinct as all that (quinone, quinone, quinone), and I'm not surprised to find that they arrest the cell cycle. But do they do it via SETD8? To be fair, they do show selectivity over the other enzymes used in the screening panel (SETD7, SETD2, and GLP). They went on to profile them against several lysine methyltransferases and several arginine methyltransferases. The most selective of the bunch was 2.5x more active against SETD8 compared to the next most active target, which is honestly not a whole lot. (And I note that the authors spent some time a few paragraphs before talking about how their activity measurements are necessarily uncertain). 
 They do address the quinone problem, but in a somewhat otherworldly manner: 

Given that SPS8I1−3 are structurally distinct except for their quinonic moiety (Figure 1a, highlighted in red), we reasoned that they may act on SETD8 differently (e.g., dependence on cofactor or substrate). . . 
 This, to many medicinal chemists, is a bit like saying that several species of poisonous snake are distinct except for their venom-filled fangs. The paper does seem to find differences in how the three inhibitors respond to varying substrate concentrations, but they also find (unsurprisingly) that all three work by covalent inhibition. Studies on mutant forms of the enzyme suggest strongly that two of the compounds are hitting a particular Cys residue (270), while the third "may target Cys residues in a more general manner". To their credit, they did try three quinone-containing compounds from commercial sources and found them inactive, but that just shows that not every quinone inhibits their enzyme. 
 This, too, is what you'd expect: if you did a full proteome analysis of what a given quinone compound hits, I'm sure that you'd find varying fingerprints for each one. But even though I have no objection to covalent inhibitors per se , I'm nervous about ones that have so many potential mechanisms. The size and shape of the three compounds shown will surely keep them from doing all the damage that a smaller quinone is capable of doing, but I fear that there's still plenty of damage in them. 
 Indeed, when they do cell assays, they find that each of the compounds has a somewhat different profile of cell cycle arrest, and say that this is probably due to their off-target effects. But they go on to wind things up like this: 

Structurally distinct SPS8I1−3 also display different modes of SETD8 inhibition. Such differences also make SPS8I1−3 less likely to act on other common cellular targets besides SETD8. As a result, the shared phenotypes of the 3 compounds are expected to be associated with SETD8 inhibition. . .Such robust inhibition of SETD8 by SPS8I1−3, together with their different off-target effects, argues that these compounds can be used collectively as SETD8 inhibitors to offset off-target effects of individual reagents. At this stage, we envision using all three compounds to examine SETD8 inhibition and then focusing on the phenotypes shared by all of them. 
 I have to disagree there. I would be quite worried about how many other cellular processes are being disrupted by these compounds. In fact, the authors already point to some of these. Their SPS8I1, they note, has already been reported as a CDC25 inhibitor. SPS8I2 has been shown to be a CDK2/4 inhibitor, and SPS8I3 has been reported as an inhibitor of a whole list of protein tyrosine phosphatases. None of these enzymes, I would guess, has any particular great structural homology with SETD8, and those activities are surely only the beginning. How is all this to be untangled? Using all three of them to study the same system is likely to just confuse things more rather than throwing light on common mechanisms. Consider the background: even a wonderful, perfectly selective SETD8 inhibitor would be expected to induce a complex set of phenotypes, varying on the cell type and the conditions. 
 And these are not wonderful inhibitors. They are quinones, aces (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2010/02/08/polluting_the_literature_with_pains) in the deck of PAINS (http://cen.acs.org/articles/92/i35/Getting-Rid-Painful-Compounds.html) . No matter what, they need a great deal more characterization before any conclusions can be drawn from their activity. A charitable view of them would be that such characterization, along with a good deal of chemistry effort, might result in derivatives that have a decent chance of hitting SETD8 in a useful manner. An uncharitable view would be that they should be poured into the red waste can before they use up any more time and money.
