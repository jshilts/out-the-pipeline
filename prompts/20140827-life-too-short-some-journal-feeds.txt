Life Is Too Short For Some Journal Feeds
27 Aug 2014

What scientific journals can you not be bothered to keep up with? I know, sometimes it's tempting to answer "all of them", but a well-informed chemist really should watch what comes out in the better ones. But how about the not-so-better ones? The "Life's too short" ones? Reading journals by RSS gives a person some perspective on signal-to-noise. 
 One problem is that Elsevier's RSS feeds are sort of perpetually hosed. Are they working now? I haven't checked in a while, because I finally gave up on them. And that means that I don't regularly look at Tetrahedron Letters or Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters , even though (once in a while) something interesting turns up there. I look at ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters more often, just because it has a working RSS feed (and I should note that I've rotated off their editorial board, by the way). Overall, though, I can't say that I miss either of those Elsevier journals, because you have to scroll through an awful lot of. . .stuff. . .to see something worth noting. 
 The same goes, I'm afraid, for Chemical Communications , and that makes me wonder if it's possible to keep up with the Letters/Communications style journals usefully at all. There are just so many papers pouring through them, and since Chem Comm takes them in from every sort of chemistry there is, vast numbers of them are of little interest to any particular reader. Their mini-review articles are perhaps an attempt to counteract this problem, and the journal also seems to have a slant towards "hot" topics. It's still in my RSS feed, but I look at the numbers of papers that pile up in it, and wonder if I should just delete and get it over with. 
 Organic Letters , on the other hand, I seem to be able to stay on top of, perhaps because it's focused down to at least organic chemistry (as opposed to Chem Comm). And I find a higher percentage of papers worth looking at than I do in Tet Lett (do others feel the same way?) And as for the other short-communications organic chemistry journals, I don't have them in the feed. Synthesis, Syn Comm, Synlett - writing this prompts me to go in and add them, but we'll see over the next couple of months if I regret it. 
 What it comes down to is that there's room for only a certain number of titles that can be followed as the papers publish. (The rest of them turn up in literature searches, responses to directed queries). And there are only a certain number of titles that are worth following in real time. So to get back to the question at the start of the post, which well-known journals do you find to be not worth the trouble?
