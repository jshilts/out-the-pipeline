Visiting Duke and GSK
12 Nov 2014

I'm on my way back from my visit to GSK and Duke. I'd never visited the GSK site in the Research Triangle (although I remember the old Burroughs Wellcome one from the mid-1980s), and it was good to see the place. There are a lot of really good people there, some of whom I've known for a long time, and others that I just met. The forum that Bernard Munos and I spoke at seemed to go over well, and I enjoyed doing it. But I couldn't help but think that one of the things energizing it was a pervasive worry at the place about further rounds of re-organization and cutbacks. As so many of us have had the chance to find out, that's not the way to enhance research productivity. Or much of anything else. 
 And the visit to Duke was quite surreal. The old Gross Chem building has been totally refurbished, and as I told people there, I don't think a more thorough exorcism could have been performed on the place. It was like walking around in some sort of science-fiction film: parts of the building exterior look exactly as they did thirty years ago, absolutely unchanged, but then you open a door or turn a corner, and there's 2014 and no doubt about it. They ripped out all the interior walls (and everything else), knocked a big skylight through the middle of the roof, and now the place, which no longer has any real chemistry-department role at all, is all full of sleek lighting, nice wood and carpeting, flat screen displays and coffee bars. I did not always have such a great time in the old building, and seeing it so thoroughly obliterated was, well, sort of inspiring. 
 My time in the present-day chemistry department was fun. I got a chance to talk with several of the younger faculty, gossip with some of the longtime ones, meet a number of grad students, and talk to a good crowd. I hope that one of the students I met took the advice I gave her: she was thinking about downloading the university-required template so that she could start on her dissertation, and I told her to do it that very evening. My general grad-school advice remains the same: the point of being there is to get out of there. Finish your degree! Do it honorably, and without making enemies, but finish your degree and move on to the rest of your life, which is most certainly not grad school.
