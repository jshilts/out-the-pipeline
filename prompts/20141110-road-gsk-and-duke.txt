On the Road: GSK and Duke
10 Nov 2014

I'm speaking at GSK today, in a forum along with Bernard Munos, which should be fun (I hope they think the same way when the day is finished!) And tomorrow I'll be giving a talk at the Duke Chemistry Department, which should be a very weird feeling indeed, since I haven't set foot there for many years now. They've moved out of the not-so-beloved "Gross Chem" building, but I do hope to see what they did during its remodeling about the chromium stain I left on the ceiling (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/02/11/how_not_to_do_it_chromium_trioxide) there. (I know from eyewitnesses that it persisted for some years).
