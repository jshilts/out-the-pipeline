Puma and Neratinib Take Longer Than Expected
3 Dec 2014

When I last wrote (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/07/23/neratinib_comes_through_for_puma) about Puma Biotechnology and their irreversible kinase inhibitor neratinib (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neratinib) , things were going great. The company had reported good Phase III data, taking investors by surprise, and the stock had shot up. An FDA filing was planned for just after the first of the year, and the future was bright. 
 The story has become complicated since then, as a lot of stories in our line of work have a tendency to do. Neratinib recently failed to beat Herceptin in a head-to-head trial (one Puma had downplayed (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/puma-shrugs-expected-phase-ii-failure-its-breast-cancer-drug/2014-11-14) , at least for that primary endpoint). And now comes more bad news (http://www.thestreet.com/story/12972400/1/puma-forced-to-delay-breast-cancer-fda-submission-due-to-new-safety-data-requirement.html) : the company has been talking about changing its target patient population, and a recent meeting with the FDA looks to delay their regulatory filing for at least a year. (They need to address some preclinical carcinogenicity data). 
 So this is not exactly a home run just yet. Neratinib may well make it through fine after the delay. But if you bought the stock when it jumped (https://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&chdd=1&chds=1&chdv=1&chvs=maximized&chdeh=0&chfdeh=0&chdet=1417612302870&chddm=50048&chls=IntervalBasedLine&q=NYSE:PBYI&ntsp=0&ei=zwt_VPnLLcWWqAGFooHoDg) back in the summer, you're flat now, and probably wondering if you're ready to be a long-term investor or not. . .
