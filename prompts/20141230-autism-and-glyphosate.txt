Autism and Glyphosate:
30 Dec 2014

I'm getting a lot of emails about a ridiculous prediction by Stephanie Seneff that "half of all children will be autistic by 2025". As far as I can tell, this is more of the same as what she was peddling in a 2013 article about glyphosate (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/04/30/is_glyphosate_poisoning_everyone) , and that one was really egregious. You see all these references to "Researchers at MIT Find Glyphosate Killing Everyone!" and the like, but that paper had no original research in it whatsoever - and although it seems to cite everything possible, it manages to miss the most important invalidating evidence. Just so my feelings about it are clear: from everything I can see, Seneff's views on glyphosate seem to me to be tendentious and shoddily backed up, and do not deserve one-tenth the credit that many people seem to be willing to give her. 
 The web site that's pushing this autism figure, in case you're wondering, also goes on about the "coverup" of the link to the MMR vaccine. This thoroughly discredited (and discreditable) claim tells me all I need to know about them - anyone pushing this line has disqualified themselves, as far as I'm concerned. I'm not going to link to them, and I'm not going to spend more of my vacation time debunking them line by line. That earlier blog post linked to above goes into more detail about just why, but that's the short answer. This is not "a new study", these are not "respected researchers", and this is not "an alarming new development". This is a load of crap. Far more is known about glyphosate toxicology and pharmacokinetics than you could ever imagine by reading it.
