The Lessons of Intercept and NASH
7 May 2014

Over at LifeSciVC, Tom Hughes has a post (http://lifescivc.com/2014/05/flint-nash-and-biotech-how-big-things-happen/) about Intercept Pharmaceuticals and their wild ride with an FXR ligand for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH (http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/nash/) ). Anyone who owned ICPT will recall that period vividly, since the positive news from the clinical trial sent the company's stock from an already-not-cheap $72/share to a where's-the-oxygen-tank peak of $445 in two days of bug-eyed trading. NASH is potentially a big market, and there's really nothing out there to treat it, so Intercept's investors (many of them apparently fresh converts to the cause) decided that the company was set to do very well for itself indeed. 
 Hughes points out that NASH is not an easy thing to get into, though. It's underserved for a reason - there are a lot of biological and mechanistic question marks, and the clinical trials are no stroll through the tulip beds, either . There's no way to be sure that you're having the desired effects without doing a series of liver biopsies on the patients, and even at that the FDA still has to issue some key regulatory guidance about whether these tissues markers will be sufficient for approval. His thesis is that it took a small company like Intercept to accept all these risks. 
 He's probably right, especially when you couple them with an uncertain market size - potentially large, but who knows for sure? It's a hard sell at a big company, where the feeling can be that if you're going to go to all that trouble, you might as well aim for a larger market while you're at it, and one with more clarity. Adding a few hundred million (maybe) to the sales figures of Leviathan Pharma might not get upper management all that excited, especially since so much stuff would have to get pioneered along the way. But adding a few hundred million to the revenues of a small company that has nothing else - now that's something worth suiting up for. All the talk about how small companies are so much more nimble and innovative (which is not always true, but certainly not all talk, either) might just come down to the old line about necessity being the mother of invention. Or Samuel Johnson's old line about when a man is to hanged in a fortnight that it concentrates his mind wonderfully - that one, too (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2009/02/23/genentechs_culture_at_risk_or_not) . 
 Intercept, for its part, has seen its stock fall back to the lowly $250-300 range, which probably isn't thrilling for the folks who bought in at $445. Actually, it fell back to that range almost immediately, then worked its way back over $400 again, and now back down to this, so there have been plenty of opportunities for hair loss among its investors. When the FDA issues its guidance in the NASH area, it will presumably go through another blast of frenzied trading, and good luck to whoever's in it (long or short) when that happens. And I haven't checked, but I'll bet that the options on this one would cost you plenty, too. From a safe distance, it should be quite a show.
