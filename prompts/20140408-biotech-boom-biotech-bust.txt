Biotech Boom, Biotech Bust?
8 Apr 2014

Here's a good one (http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2014/03/27/three-misplaced-assumptions-that-could-end-the-biotech-boom/) by Matthew Herper on "Three Misplaced Assumptions That Could End the Biotech Boom". Given the way the biotech stock index has been performing lately, with a horrendous March and April that's taken it into negative territory (https://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&chdd=1&chds=1&chdv=1&chvs=maximized&chdeh=0&chfdeh=0&chdet=1396963218308&chddm=25806&chls=IntervalBasedLine&q=NASDAQ:IBB&ntsp=0&ei=hfdDU7CoF6f16gGHsQE) for the year to date, something definitely seems to be causing a change of mind. 
 I'll let you see what Herper's three assumptions are, but I can tell you already that they sound valid to me. I think that his points are particularly relevant to investors who may have been jumping on the stocks in the area without having a clear idea of what the industry is really like. As he says, ". . .investors should avoid thinking that the drug business has undergone a fundamental change in the past few years. It hasn’t." It's the same fun-filled thrill ride as ever!
