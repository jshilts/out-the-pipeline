 But now Alnylam is testing a drug to treat (familial amyloid polyneuropathy) in advanced human trials. It’s the last hurdle before the company will seek regulatory approval to put the drug on the market. Although it’s too early to tell how well the drug will alleviate symptoms, it’s doing what the researchers hoped it would: it can decrease the production of the protein that causes FAP by more than 80 percent. 
 This could be just the beginning for RNAi. Alnylam has more than 11 drugs, including ones for hemophilia, hepatitis B, and even high cholesterol, in its development pipeline, and has three in human trials —progress that led the pharmaceutical company Sanofi to make a $700 million investment in the company last winter. Last month, the pharmaceutical giant Roche, an early Alnylam supporter that had given up on RNAi, reversed its opinion of the technology as well, announcing a $450 million deal to acquire the RNAi startup Santaris. All told, there are about 15 RNAi-based drugs in clinical trials from several research groups and companies. 
 “The world went from believing RNAi would change everything to thinking it wouldn’t work, to now thinking it will,” says Robert Langer, a professor at MIT, and one of Alnylam’s advisors. 
 Those Phase III results will be great to see - that's the real test of a technology like this one. A lot of less daring ideas have fallen over when exposed to that much of a reality check. If RNAi really has turned the corner, though, I think it could well be just the beginning of a change coming over the pharmaceutical industry. Biology might be riding over the hill, after an extended period of hearing hoofbeats and seeing distant clouds of dust. 
 There was a boom in this sort of thinking during the 1980s, in the early days of Genentech and Biogen (and others long gone, like Cetus). Proteins were going to conquer the world, with interferon often mentioned as the first example of what was sure to be a horde of new drugs. Then in the early 1990s there was a craze for antisense, which was going to remake the whole industry. Antibodies, though, were surely a big part of the advance scouting party - many people are still surprised (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/11/19/small_molecules_slipping_off_the_list) when they see how many of the highest-grossing drugs are antibodies, even though they're often for smaller indications. 
 And the hype around RNA therapies did reach (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2006/10/02/rna_interference_film_at_eleven) a pretty high level a few years ago, but this (as Langer's quote above says) was followed (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2011/08/02/merck_rnai_alnylam_and_so_on) by a nasty pullback (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2010/11/17/roche_has_problems_but_rna_interference_has_more) . If it really is heading for the big time, then we should all be ready for some other techniques to follow. Just as RNAi built on the knowledge gained during the struggle to realize antisense, you'd have to think that Moderna's mRNA therapy ideas have learned from the RNAi people, and that the attempts to do CRISPR-style gene editing (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/02/03/the_return_of_gene_therapy_and_more) in humans have the whole biologic therapy field to help them out. Science does indeed march on, and we might possibly be getting the hang of some of these things. 
 And as I warned in that last link, that means we're in for some good old creative destruction in this industry if that happens. Some small-molecule ideas are going to go right out the window, and following them (through a much larger window) could be the whole rare-disease business model that so many companies are following these days. Many of those rare diseases are just the sorts of things that could be attacked more usefully at their root cause via genomic-based therapies, so if those actually start to work, well. . . 
 This shouldn't be news to anyone who's following the field closely, but these things move slowly enough that they have a way of creeping up on you unawares. Come back in 25 years, and the therapeutic landscape might be a rather different-looking place.
