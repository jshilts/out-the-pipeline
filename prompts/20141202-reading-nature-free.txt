Reading Nature For Free
2 Dec 2014

This will be interesting to watch: Nature (and 48 other journals of the Nature Publishing Group) are experimenting with making their current paper and archives open to view (http://www.nature.com/news/nature-makes-all-articles-free-to-view-1.16460) , but not to save or print. 
 ReadCube, a software platform similar to Apple’s iTunes, will be used to host and display read-only versions of the articles' PDFs. If the initiative becomes popular, it may also boost the prospects of the ReadCube platform, in which Macmillan has a majority investment. 
 Annette Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan’s Science and Education division, says that under the policy, subscribers can share any paper they have access to through a link to a read-only version of the paper’s PDF that can be viewed through a web browser. For institutional subscribers, that means every paper dating back to the journal's foundation in 1869, while personal subscribers get access from 1997 on. 
 Anyone can subsequently repost and share this link. Around 100 media outlets and blogs will also be able to share links to read-only PDFs. Although the screen-view PDF cannot be printed, it can be annotated — which the publisher says will provide a way for scientists to collaborate by sharing their comments on manuscripts. PDF articles can also be saved to a free desktop version of ReadCube, similarly to how music files can be saved in iTunes. 
 I don't seem to be in the top 100 media outlets, or if I am, I haven't heard about it yet. But I'm looking forward to trying this out. My company will pay for whatever papers we need, but this will be a way to get lots of good information without having to go through that process, or that expense. This policy seems to split the difference in the great open-access war, and may make strong advocates of either side less than happy. More thoughts as the advantages (and disadvantages) of all this become clearer. . .
