How Many Elements Have You Used, As Elements?
13 May 2014

I've written before about how many different elements I've used over the course of my chemical career, but here's a more demanding variant (http://theorganicsolution.wordpress.com/2014/05/13/elemental-chemistry/) of that question: how many elements have you used in their elemental form? Here's my list - I'm including things that have been transformed, and some that haven't, but I'm not counting structural metals: 
 Hydrogen (hydrogenations, naturally) 
 Helium (carrier gas in GC) 
 Lithium (Barbier reactions, Birch reduction, etc.) 
 Carbon (decolorizing) 
 Nitrogen (inert gas) 
 Oxygen (oxidized a couple of anions over the years, etc.) 
 Sodium (making alkoxides, Birch reduction) 
 Magnesium (Grignard formation) 
 Phosphorus (red phosphorus in a halogenation) 
 Sulfur (cleaning up mercury!) 
 Argon (inert gas) 
 Potassium (drying solvents) 
 Iron (reduction of nitro groups) 
 Nickel (as Raney nickel) 
 Copper (making carbenes, among other things) 
 Zinc (reductions, zinc-copper couple) 
 Selenium (as a catalyst in a Kjeldahl, years ago as an undergraduate) 
 Bromine (many nasty brominations) 
 Ruthenium (hydrogenation catalyst) 
 Rhodium (high-pressure hydrogenation, once) 
 Palladium (hydrogenation) 
 Silver (well, produced some in a Tollens) 
 Tin (reduction) 
 Iodine (Grignard initiation, TLC) 
 Platinum (hydrogenation) 
 Mercury (vacuum lines, etc.) 
 So that takes me to 24 26 elements used in their pure forms, 21 of them as part of actual chemical transformations, more or less. Notable omissions are sulfur, which I don't think I've actually used as elemental sulfur , and chlorine (not quite). There are a few other opportunities ( silver , samarium, and indium I've seen used as the metals, for example), but not that many, at least for an organic chemist. 
 Updates are due to people reminding me of things in the comments! And no, I don't think I've ever used samarium metal itself, although that's certainly another easy one to rack up. As for Raney nickel, it starts out being an aluminum/nickel alloy, but my impression was that the aluminum got pretty well eaten out of it by all that sodium hydroxide. I've made the stuff (once), and a more tedious experience I do not wish for. I've also realized that I used elemental sulfur one time as an undergrad, along with elemental copper, to make cupric sulfide, which is perhaps a more elevated activity than cleaning up mercury spills.
