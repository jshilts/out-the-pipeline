The 2013 Drug Approvals: Not So Great?
6 Jan 2014

So we finished the year with 27 new drugs approved. Compared to the 39 approvals the year before, is that a reversion to the mean, a sudden downturn, a meaningless fluctuation, or what? 
 John Carroll seems to be (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/special-reports/ominous-trend-resurfaces-new-drug-approvals-plunge-2013) in the "something to worry about" camp at FierceBiotech : 
 The wave of new drug approvals that had been building at the FDA has broken. According to the official tally of new drug and biologics approvals at the agency, the biopharma industry registered only 27 OKs for new entities in 2013--a sharp plunge from 2012's high of 39 that once again raises big questions about the productivity and sustainability of the world's multibillion-dollar R&D business. 
 After 2012 some experts boasted that the industry had turned a corner, with the agency boasting that it was outstripping the Europeans in the speed and number of new drug approvals. But for 2013 the numbers look a lot closer to the bleak average of 24 new approvals per year seen in the first decade of the millennium than the 35 per year projected by McKinsey through 2016. 
 And here's Bernard Munos (http://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmunos/2014/01/03/the-fda-approvals-of-2013-a-watershed/) at Forbes on the same topic. He thinks that looking at the industry as a monolith might be obscuring something: 
 Overall, 2013 was good or great for half of big pharma, and forgettable for the rest. Is this the beginning of a split in the group that has long dominated the industry? Some companies may counter that approval statistics is a lagging indicator that reflects past performance and not the promise of their pipelines. If one looks at FDA’s Breakthrough Designations, however, which is a leading indicator of pipeline quality, they tend to show the same picture, and cluster around the companies that have been most successful. . .Success seems to beget success, which suggests that today’s winners may also be tomorrow’s winners. 
 One thing remains worrisome: 11 new drugs per year — the average big pharma output for the last 5 years — is not enough to support these companies’ $370 billion of current sales, especially since only 3 or 4 will become blockbusters. The giddy promises to deliver 2 drugs per year consistently have not materialized, and there is no indication that they will. . . 
 (You can tell he's never gotten over Lilly's promise some years ago to deliver approvals on that schedule, and who could blame him)? As for me, I wish that I had some sort of crystal-ball insight to deliver, but I don't. Drug discovery (and thus NDA filings and approvals) seems to be such a statistically noisy process that it's hard to draw conclusions from a year or two of data. Let's watch what happens this year and see both what the numbers are and how the FDA and the companies involve try to interpret them. One thing to note already is how some people were ready to use the 2012 approvals as clear evidence that the industry was getting more productive - are the 2013 numbers such clear evidence in the other direction, or not?
