Amylin Fibrils and Aspirin: No Connection
12 Jun 2014

There have been reports (https://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-2003-37493) that the classic oral antiinflammatory drugs (such as aspirin and ketoprofen) might slow the progress of diabetes. The rationale is that they seem, at physiological concentrations, to inhibit the formation of amyloid-type fibrils in islet cells, and that's thought to be part of their loss of function. 
 But a new paper (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/cb500162w) in ACS Chemical Biology seems to demolish that whole idea, and it's a good thing for anyone studying protein aggregation to have a look at. The authors (from NYU and Stony Brook) do a thorough job on the protein behavior, studying it by a wider ranger of techniques than the previous work (right-angle light scattering, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and others). Earlier work relied on CD spectra (which may have been misinterpreted) and Congo Red staining, which is a classic method for detecting amyloids of various origins, but is also subject to a lot of problems. This latest paper finds no effect for the anti-inflammatories, and suggests that the earlier results are experimental artifacts. TEM is apparently the way to go if you really want to be sure that you're looking at fibrils. 
 Protein aggregation is definitely not my field, but I was glad to take a look at this paper anyway. It highlights the trickiness of working with these things, and shows how easy it is to get fooled by apparently positive results. These are lessons that apply to plenty of other areas of research, and we could all benefit by keeping them in mind. Whack your hypothesis as hard as you can, with as many experimental techniques as you can. If it breaks apart, that's too bad - but you're better off knowing that, and so is everyone else.
