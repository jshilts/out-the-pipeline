Back Ordered, I'll Bet
30 Apr 2014

I've actually never heard of "Ebuychem.com", but a reader sent this interesting page (http://www.ebuychem.com/product/EBD1113014.html) along to me. So if you're in the market for "octa-azacubane" (yep, that's just as crazy as it sounds, if not crazier, a solid cube o' nitrogen atoms), then they're inviting you to query their sellers about availability. If that's in their database, what isn't?
