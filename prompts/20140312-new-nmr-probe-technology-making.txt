The authors describe a very sensitive way to convert weak radio/microwave signals to an optical readout, with very low noise. And looking over the paper, that's one of the applications they suggest as well, so that's about as far into physics as I'll get today. But the idea looks quite interesting, and if it means that you can get higher sensitivity without having to use cryoprobes and other expensive gear, then speed the day.
