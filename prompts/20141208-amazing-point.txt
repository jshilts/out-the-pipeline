Amazing, Up to a Point
8 Dec 2014

A friend of mine in the drug discovery business asked me this morning on the train if I'd seen "60 Minutes" last night. I hadn't, but he went on to tell me about a report they'd done on Patrick Soon-Shiong, an entrepreneur who's trying to change cancer diagnosis and therapy. What struck my colleague was that pretty much all the points made during the piece seemed to him, as an experienced drug discovery scientist, to be pretty common knowledge, but that the program treated them as a series of amazing breakthroughs. 
 Matthew Herper has more here (http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2014/12/07/here-is-what-60-minutes-didnt-tell-you-about-the-billionaire-who-is-trying-to-disrupt-cancer-care/) , based on a longer report (http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2014/09/10/medicines-manhattan-project-can-the-worlds-richest-doctor-fix-health-care/2/) he wrote back in September. Overall, he has a favorable impression of Soon-Shiong, but not a universally favorable one. Well worth a read.
