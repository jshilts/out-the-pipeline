Alzheimer's in Cell Culture?
13 Oct 2014

While we're talking about cell culture, there's some potentially significant news (http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/science/2014/10/12/researchers-replicate-alzheimer-brain-cells-petri-dish/vV9dAPIPnWUHktTl5Bu4EM/story.html) in Alzheimer's. The Tanzi lab (http://www.massgeneral.org/research/researchlab.aspx?id=1402) at Mass General is reporting inNature (http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature13800.html) Nature that they've been able to grow 3D neuronal cultures that actually reproduce the plaque-and-tangle symptoms of Alzheimer's. That's quite a surprise - neurons are notoriously badly behaved in vitro , and Alzheimer's has been a beast to model in any system at all. You can't even get neurons from human Alzheimer's patients to behave like that when you culture them (at least, I've never heard of it being done). 
 These new cultures apparently respond to secretase inhibitors, which on one level is good news - since you'd expect those compounds to have an effect on them. On the other hand, such compounds have been quite ineffective in human trials, so there's a disconnect here. Is there more to Alzheimer's that these cell cultures don't pick up, or are the compounds much less better-behaved in vivo (or both)? 
 This new system, if validated, would seem to open up a whole new avenue for phenotypic screening, which until now has been a lost cause where Alzheimer's is concerned. It's going to be quite interesting to see how this develops, and to see what it can teach us about the real disease. Nothing in this area has come easy, and a break would be welcome. The tricky part will be whether compounds that come out of such a screen will be telling us something about Alzheimer's, or just telling us something about the model. That's always the tricky part. 
 Update: FierceBiotech notes that (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/mgh-investigator-tanzi-says-breakthrough-will-revolutionize-alzheimers-rd/2014-10-13) Tanzi's "previous insights about Alzheimer's have run into some serious setbacks."
