For Some Folks, It's New Year's Day
20 Mar 2014

A quick "eid-e shoma mubarak" to all those out there who are celebrating Norouz, the spring-equinox version of New Year's Day. My Iranian wife certainly is, and I will be pitching in by consuming large amounts of the home-made sweets that her mother has produced, and by frying a large quantity of fish for a big meal later on. For once, there's actually some blue sky and sunshine out there today (albeit with heaps of melting snow everywhere). But it sure beats a faceful of sleet, which has been the case several times in years past. (If you've ever seen the old W. C. Fields short, "The Fatal Glass of Beer", you'll get the idea of what my wife goes through (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcGfuEZ9dSo) on a typical New England Norouz!)
