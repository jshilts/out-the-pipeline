K. C. Nicolaou on Drug Discovery
15 Jul 2014

K. C. Nicolaou has an article (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201404761/abstract) in the latest Angewandte Chemie on the future of drug discovery, which may seem a bit surprising, considering that he's usually thought of as Mister Total Synthesis, rather than Mister Drug Development Project. But I can report that it's relentlessly sensible. Maybe too sensible. It's such a dose of the common wisdom that I don't think it's going to be of much use or interest to people who are actually doing drug discovery - you've already had all these thoughts yourself, and more than once. 
 But for someone catching up from outside the field, it's not a bad survey at all. It gets across how much we don't know, and how much work there is to be done. And one thing that writing this blog has taught me is that most people outside of drug discovery don't have an appreciation of either of those things. Nicolaou's article isn't aimed at a lay audience, of course, which makes it a little more problematic, since many of the people who can appreciate everything he's saying will already know what he's going to say. But it does round pretty much everything up into one place.
