Seaborgium hexacarbonyl
23 Sep 2014

If you want to really push the frontiers of analytical chemistry, try making compounds of the superheavy elements. Science is reporting (http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6203/1491.full) the characterization of seaborgium hexacarbonyl, which gives us all a chance to use Sg in an empirical formula. We're not going to be using it too often, though, because this work (http://www.uni-mainz.de/presse/17619_ENG_HTML.php) was conducted on eighteen atoms of Sg, and that's at least as hard as it sounds. You have several seconds in which to do all your work, and then it's back to the gigantic particle accelerator to see if you can make another atom or two. Separating these from the various decay products and other stuff is one of the hardest parts of that process, and was a key step in getting this experiment to work at all. 
 The reason for going to all this trouble was the predicted behavior of the valence electrons. Elements of this size are rather strange in that regard, in that the outer inner-shell electrons (corrected: jet-lag, I think - DBL) are relativistic - Sg's have velocities of about 0.8c, which leads to some unusual effects. The element itself doesn't differ as much from its other periodic relatives (as opposed to (http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v388/n6637/full/388055a0.html) 104 Rutherfordium and 105 Dubnium), but compounds leaving some outer-shell electrons free were still calculated to show some changes. In this case, the hexacarbonyl had similar behavior to the molybdenum and tungsten complexes, but its properties only come out right if you take the relativistic effects into account. So both Mendeleev and Einstein come out well in this one. 
 Irrationally, this makes seaborgium more of a "real" element to me (there have been a couple of other compounds reported before as well). Single atoms seem to me to be the province of physics, but once you start describing compounds, it's chemistry.
