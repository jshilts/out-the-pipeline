Down With the Western Blot?
30 Oct 2014

A reader sends along a thought that touches on a lot of the publication scandals that have happened in molecular biology over the years. A very common feature of these is manipulation of Western blots (see that graphic the other day (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/10/27/fazlul_sarkar_subpoenas_pubpeer) on the Sarkar case, assembled by a reader of Retraction Watch who goes under the name of "Scrutineer", for an excellent example). In the hands of the unscrupulous, images get duplicated, swapped, stretched, flipped, contrast-adjusted and digitally whitewashed, all in the name of making a good story. 
 But gel images seem to be an essential part of publication in these fields. Papers in any kind of protein-level biology work are full of lane after lane illustrating experimental changes and controls - no one would believe the work without them, but it's getting to the point that people are wondering what work to believe with them. The question is, is there something better? 
 Because when you get right down to it, a picture of a blot is a pretty low-information object. Bands are there, or they aren't. If there are a lot of bands, it's not like anyone knows what they all are - the only thing you can say is that this sample isn't so clean, or this protein didn't express so well. Contrast this to the sorts of characterization that you can do on smaller organic molecules. You have distinctive fingerprints of proton and carbon NMR, high-res mass spec (with its isotopic distributions and fragmentation patterns) - even good old IR, which no one uses much any more, gives a lot of information in a compound-specific readout. But for molecular biology, it's "this lane has a band" versus "this lane doesn't have a band". It's as if the chemistry journals were full of TLC plate images, which they most certainly aren't. 
 It's for sure that characterization of proteins is a much harder business than the characterization of small molecules. I can see why the blot-image standard got started, and why it persists. But it's too easy to fake, too easy to manipulate. Is there anything to replace it, or to enhance it to the point where you can't just whip one up in ten minutes at the keyboard? I know that editorial staffs at the major journals have been thinking about this problem, but how much progress is being made? It's still a key part of work at the bench, but when it comes time to publish, is it time to say goodbye to the plain old Western? 
 Update: I should have said that no one uses IR for small-molecule characterization. A strong dissent (http://www.rheothing.com/2014/10/no-one-uses-ir-anymore.html?m=1) from the polymer side.
