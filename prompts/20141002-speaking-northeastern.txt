Speaking at Northeastern
2 Oct 2014

For anyone at Northeastern University here in Boston who would be interested in attending, I'll be speaking this evening at 6 to the student affiliate ACS there, in Hurtig Hall (Room 115). If you'd like to attend, let them know at acs.neu@gmail.com. And don't eat my portion of pizza before I get there - I'll need it to remain coherent. Turn down too much free pizza and they'll kick you out of almost any scientific society there is, you know.
