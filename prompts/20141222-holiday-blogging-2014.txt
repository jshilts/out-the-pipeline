Holiday Blogging 2014
22 Dec 2014

As of today, posting will be irregular around here until New Year's. I'm not going to disappear entirely (I still have some topics backed up to write about), but the holiday season will slow things down. And I promise, as has been the practice here, to post a recipe or two, since cooking is the next thing to chemistry.
