One of Those Days
18 Aug 2014

I spent the morning in the lab pretty much destroying whatever I touched: wrong solvents for chromatography, dropping things in the sink, bumping solutions all over the inside of my rota-vap. This is, though, a Monday, so at least I have that to blame. But if everyone started out the week the way I did, then scientific progress came to a juddering halt around 11 AM EST. My hope is that I can be less of a wrecking ball during the rest of the day and start working my way back into positive territory.
