Aileron Heads Toward the Clinic
29 Oct 2014

Aileron, the stapled-peptide company, has had its ups and downs over the past few years. They went through the typical cut-back-hard (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/07/11/more_from_warp_drive_bio_and_less_from_aileron) phase not too long ago, but have been rounding up more money (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/armed-48m-bankroll-aileron-sets-sights-p53-tumor-target/2014-10-29) to try out their p53-targeted idea (blogged on here (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/08/15/aileron_reports_some_stapled_peptide_results) ). 
 I'm glad to hear it. I would really like to see how some good stapled-peptide candidates performs in the clinic, and the p53 pathway is just the sort of hard-to-drug place you'd go with one. Aileron has one in Phase I in the growth-hormone pathway, but there's been very little news of it, from what I can see. I hope there's enough money to do a good job with these things.
