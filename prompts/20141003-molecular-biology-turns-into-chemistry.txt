The authors are studying the movement of a transcription factor protein along a stretch of DNA having two of its recognition sites, and using NMR to figure out how it transfers from one to the other. Does it leave one DNA molecule, dissociate into solution, and land on another? Does it slide along the DNA strand to the next site? Or does it do a sort of hop or backflip while still staying with the same DNA piece? 
 Now, to a first approximation, you may well not care. And I have no particular interest in the HoxD9 transcription factor myself. But I do find transcription factors in general of interest as drug targets - very hard drug targets that need all the help that they can get. The molecular-biology level of understanding starts out like this: there are protein transcription factors that bind to DNA. The protein sequences are (long list), and the DNA sequences that they recognize are (long list), and the selectivities that they show are (even longer list, and getting longer all the time). Under (huge set of specific conditions), a given transcription factor has been found to (facilitate and/or repress) expression of (huge list of specific genes). (Monstrously complex list of) associated proteins have been found to be involved in these processes. 
 I'm not making fun of this stuff - that's a lot of information, and people have worked very hard to get it. But as you go further into the subject, you have to stop treating these things are modules, boxy shapes on a whiteboard, or database entries, and start treating them as molecules, and that's where things have been going for some years now. When a transcription factor recognizes a stretch of DNA, how exactly does it do that? What's the structure of the protein in the DNA-recognition element, and what interactions does it make with the DNA itself? What hydrogen bonds are formed, what conformational changes occur, what makes the whole process thermodynamically favorable? If you really want to know that in detail, you're going to be accounting for every atom's position and how it got there. That is a chemistry-level understanding of the situation: it's not just Hox9a, it's a big molecule, interacting with another big molecule, and that interaction needs to be understood in all its detail. 
 We are not there yet. I say that without fear of contradiction, but it's clearly where we need to go, and where a lot of research groups are going. This paper is just one example; there are plenty of others. I think that all of molecular biology is getting pulled this way - studying proteins, for example, inevitably leads you to studying their structure (and to the protein folding problem), and you can't understand that without treating it at an atom-by-atom scale. Individual hydrogen bonds, water molecule interactions, pi-stacks and other such phenomena are essential parts of the process. 
 So down with the whiteboard shapes and the this-goes-to-this arrows. Those are OK for shorthand, but it's time we figured out what they're shorthand for.
