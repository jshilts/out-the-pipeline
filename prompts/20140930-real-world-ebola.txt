Real-World Ebola
30 Sep 2014

As opposed to people who are telling Liberians (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/09/26/the_deadly_stupidities_around_ebola) to fear foreign medical help for the Ebola epidemic, here's a CNN story (http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/27/health/ebola-hiv-drug/) about a local doctor who's trying everything he has available. He has desperately ill patients, but may have seen some positive results with lamivudine (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamivudine) (3-TC), a nucleoside analog that's been used for HIV and hepatitis B infections. It's not impossible that it might be effective against a filovirus like Ebola - an adenosine derivative, BCX4430, has just been reported (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24590073) with some promising drug against filovirus infection, and nucleosides in general are the first general class you think of as antivirals. (I can find no references to other reports of the compound being used against Ebola or related viruses). 
 So I'd like to recognize Dr. Gobee Logan, of Tubmanburg (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubmanburg) , Liberia. He and others like him are risking their lives to treat their patients under these conditions, and are having to try whatever they can in the process. If he's come across an existing drug that could be useful, even better. Given the mortality rates that have been seen in this outbreak, it's worth a try.
