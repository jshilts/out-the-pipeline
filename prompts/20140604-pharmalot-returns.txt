Pharmalot Returns
4 Jun 2014

I'm glad to report that Ed Silverman has revived the Pharmalot blog (http://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2014/06/03/pharmalot-3-0-you-cant-keep-a-good-blog-down-2/) , now at the Wall Street Journal. This is the third iteration, and I'm glad to see that it's as unkillable as it appears to be!
