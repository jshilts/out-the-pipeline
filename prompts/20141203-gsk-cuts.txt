GSK Cuts
3 Dec 2014

Word is so far that about 900 R&D jobs are leaving GlaxoSmithKline's site in the Research Triangle Park. An "undisclosed number" will be offered positions back at the Philadelphia site, but no one seems to have any estimates on how many that will be. There's also word that one of the company's CRO partners (http://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Clinical-Development/GSK-selects-Parexel-and-PPD-as-strategic-CROs) , Parexel, will be running a unit at RTP and will hire "some" of the people who have been let go, but I have no more details on that yet, either. 
 But GlaxoSmithKline itself seems to have basically exited North Carolina, which is a damned shame. That site has a long history, and a lot of good work has been done there. 
 Update: Looks like there will be some cuts in Philadelphia, too, as well as at some other GSK locations outside the US. I'm hearing complaints that the information being presented is so vague as to make it hard to figure out what's going on (other than the broad take-home, which is that the company is getting significantly smaller). 
 Update: Here's as much (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/struggling-glaxosmithkline-rips-rtp-rd-group-global-reorganization/2014-12-03) as FierceBiotech has been able to get out of the company on the situation. 
 Update : More from WRAL (http://wraltechwire.com/sources-gsk-cutting-hundreds-of-jobs-in-triangle/14241299/) . The company has filed a notice with the state that they are eliminating approximately 900 jobs (confirming the figure given here this morning). The letter also notes that up to 450 people could end up being employed by Paraxel, but no timetable is given on when that might ramp up, or under what conditions. 
 Update People in the comments section doubt the figures in the company's WARN letter to the state. Claims are being made that the numbers are actually going to have to be far higher, given the cuts that people in different areas are seeing with their own eyes. And internationally, the Singapore site is said to be gone, with others uncertain.
