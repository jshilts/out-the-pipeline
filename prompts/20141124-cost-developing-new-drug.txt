The Cost of Developing A New Drug
24 Nov 2014

The Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development has a new estimate (http://csdd.tufts.edu/news/complete_story/pr_tufts_csdd_2014_cost_study) for the cost of developing a new drug. Past estimates have been greeted with a range of reactions, not all of them favorable. In general, people who actually do drug R&D tend to find the Tufts numbers reasonably credible, and people who are upset with the industry's pricing structures tend to find them egregiously inflated. 
 Bruce Booth has an excellent breakdown (http://lifescivc.com/2014/11/a-billion-here-a-billion-there-the-cost-of-making-a-drug-revisited/) of the latest iteration. Rather than do something similar, I'm going to refer people to his post. As he points out, there are three components to the Tufts numbers: the direct cost of developing a drug, the attrition rate (and paying for past failures), and the time/opportunity cost of the investment. Many of the disagreements about these estimates come from people who only want to talk about the first part. Unfortunately, if you actually want to use real money to develop a real drug, the other two come into play. 
 Bruce's analysis indicates that the Tufts assumptions for the second and third parts are probably pretty accurate, but he spends some time going into the direct cost section, since in recent years the proportion of orphan/small indication drugs has risen. But overall, his conclusion is that "If the Tufts estimate is off the mark for the entire industry, it doesn’t appear off by a huge amount, and certainly not the order of magnitude implied by the critics." Considering that some (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2011/03/07/the_costs_of_drug_research_beginning_a_rebuttal) of those critics (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/08/09/getting_drug_research_really_really_wrong#comments) have advanced numbers (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/08/13/donald_light_responds_on_drug_innovation_and_costs) that are more than two orders of magnitude off, I think he's right.
