Deadly Incompetence in India
24 Nov 2014

Here, then, is the bottom of the drug-manufacturing barrel: the recent case (http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Chhattisgarh-botched-operations-Minister-confirms-rat-poison-in-drugs/articleshow/45253635.cms) in India where women at a sterilization clinic were poisoned by defective ciprofloxacin tablets. They were supposed to be getting 500mg of the antibiotic, but after several deaths, analysis has shown there there was perhaps 300mg of the actual drug present, and some zinc phosphide rat poison (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_phosphide) as well. 
 This is horrifying and inexplicable. Zinc phosphide is a smelly grey-to-black powder, and ciprofloxacin is white and odorless. It goes without saying that no facility processing antibiotic tablets should be preparing rodenticide as well, and there is no way that the two could be mixed short of absolutely criminal incompetence. The companies involved are two Indian generic manufacturers, Mahawar Pharmaceutical and Kavita Pharma. There are reports in the Indian press that when authorities raided the companies for samples of the drugs that a significant amount of drug material appeared to have been recently burnt (http://www.firstpost.com/india/chhattisgarh-sterilisation-deaths-rodenticide-zinc-phosphide-found-medicines-1804741.html) . 
 India has major problems (http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-india-medical-care-20141115-story.html#page=1) with corruption in its state-run health care, and there are suspicions in this case as well. (The press is also reporting that at least one of the companies has been fined for substandard or fake drugs in the recent past, which brings up the question of why the government was dealing with them now). And overall, the top end of Indian technology and medicine is something that the country can be proud of - but the bottom is a disgrace, as Indian citizens themselves are well aware.
