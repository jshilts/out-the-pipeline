Clinical Trials in Ebola
5 Nov 2014

So with various Ebola vaccines and therapies in development, how exactly are the necessary clinical trials going to be run? That's always a tricky business with an infectious disease that comes and goes - the current Ebola outbreak is by far the largest yet seen, but there are years when no cases are reported at all. You're not going to be able to round up a traditional clinical trial cohort very easily, and the difficulties are even greater considering the areas where the patients are most likely to be found. 
 Steve Usdin atBioCentury (https://www.biocentury.com/biotech-pharma-news/regulation/2014-11-03/how-fda-nih-plan-to-pull-off-a-randomized-adaptive-ebola-trial-a11) BioCentury and Steve Kanters atThe Lancet (http://globalhealth.thelancet.com/2014/10/10/evaluating-ebola-interventions-adaptive-designs-should-be-commonplace) The Lancet come to the same conclusion: adaptive clinical trial designs. Not everyone is on board with the idea of randomized clinical trials at all, though: 
 FDA, NIH, academic investigators and biopharmaceutical companies are collaborating on the design of an adaptive, randomized controlled trial of Ebola therapies that could be conducted in the U.S. and Liberia, Luciana Borio, FDA assistant commissioner for counterterrorism policy, told BioCentury last week. 
 The protocol will be a sharp departure from trials planned by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), the Wellcome Trust and other non-governmental organizations, which have argued randomized controlled studies are unethical as well as impractical. For Ebola, the control would consist of best supportive care, as no treatments have been approved. 
 FDA's Borio, however, contends that randomized, controlled trials are ethical, practical and necessary. The agency and NIH have forged a collaboration with investigators at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and Emory University to develop a protocol that will not only determine whether treatments are effective and safe, but also speed any compounds that pass the test to patients as part of a rapidly evolving standard of care. 
 I agree that running a traditional randomized trial in this situation would be a bad idea, but as much as I respect the work done by MSF, I disagree that we have to ditch the whole idea. With the standard of supportive care improving in West Africa, it could be very difficult to figure out if anything was helping at all. The adaptive/Bayesian designs make a lot of sense here. From the Lancet piece: 
 The first, and simpler, suggested adaptive trial design would combine response-adaptive randomisation and adaptive stopping rules. In combination, these optimise trial timing by stopping the trial as quickly as possible following the ascertainment of treatment benefit or harm. Clearly, a trial design that is more timely and whose end is based on either efficacy, inefficacy, or pre-determined sample size is more ethical than traditional designs, which primarily end based on predetermined sample sizes or time-periods. Furthermore, adaptive randomisation is a randomisation schedule that allows more patients to be given the treatment that appears to be more effective as the trial is conducted. 
 Data collection and standardization will still be a major challenge, but one that I think is worth meeting. Otherwise, I fear a bunch of "Well, that sort of helped, we kind of think" data, and that will do no one any good at all. There are many arguing that a randomized trial of the Ebola therapies would be unethical, but I don't see how anything else can be. The key is to make the trials as fast and effective as they can be.
