The author details his participation in a clinical trial for an asthma therapy being developed by Amgen at a clinic in Newport Beach (CA). He doesn't say what the drug was, but my guess (http://www.clinicalconnection.com/patientviewstudy23645.aspx) is that it's brodalumab, an anti-IL17 antibody which has been in trials for asthma and psoriasis. 
 What he recounts is very disturbing. Here's a sample: 
 Moment of Truth #2 came during one of the many whispering sessions they gave me. The lead technician had a disturbing habit of frequently pulling me into a corner or another room and whispering things like “We’re just going to say that you take this medication.” I had to fill out numerous questionnaires, and she would often stand over me and whisper which answer I should mark. At last, one day after a battery of breathing tests, questionnaires, and vital-sign checks, it was required that the doctor (listed as the principal investigator on this study) verify all this, personally examine me, and sign off on it. Amgen was very clear on that point. “But he’s not here today,” she whispered, “so we’re just going to mark this off and send it through. We’ve already done everything he was going to do anyway.” By now I knew this contractor was willfully and knowingly giving Amgen invalid data, and I resolved to stick with it only long enough to see what more I could learn. I’d already decided I would not complete the trial and contribute bad data to a medical clinical trial. 
 It gets worse from there. The comments to Brian Dunning's post are already starting to fill up with the expected "Yeah, that's what Big Pharma does" stuff. So I'd like to help provide an antidote to that: Hey Amgen! Hey FDA! Check out this Newport Beach trial center! Dig into these allegations, and do something about them. And tell everyone what you've found! 
 Update: some readers are asking how anyone can be sure that this description is real. We can't, although it's certainly a detailed description, and attached to the name of someone with a good bit of internet traffic and associated notoriety (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Dunning_(author)) . Mind you, some of that associated notoriety is a conviction (http://www.briandunning.com/message.html) for wire fraud. But in a "cui bono" sense, I don't see any reason for someone to make up the details in this account. 
 And how accurate it is should be an immediate concern for Amgen. In this business, we not only have to be death on clinical trial fraud, but we also have to be seen to be death on clinical trial fraud, so that (1) other people won't get the impression that it's a good idea, and (2) the general public won't get the impression that we're a bunch of crooks. So one way or another, these allegations have to be looked at, pronto. 
 Second update: see the comments section. Adam Feuerstein reports that Amgen has told him that they're already investigating this, which is just what the company should be doing. Glad to see them moving this quickly!
