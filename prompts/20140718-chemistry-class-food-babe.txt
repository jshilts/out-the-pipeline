Chemistry Class For the
18 Jul 2014

I found this article from the Charlotte Observer on the "Food Babe" (Vani Hari) very interesting. A "menu consultant" for Chick-Fil-A, is she? Who knew? 
 I've come across a horribly long string of chemistry misapprehensions, mistakes, and blunders while looking at her site - she truly appears to know nothing whatsoever about chemistry, not that this would appear to bother her much. (Wavefunction has a good article (http://wavefunction.fieldofscience.com/2014/07/the-problem-with-food-babe.html) on these). I noticed in the comments section of the newspaper's article that someone is apparently trying to crowdsource (https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/chemistry-courses-for-vani-hari-the-food-babe--2) a fundraising drive to send her to some chemistry classes. I enjoy that idea very much, although (1) horse, water, drink, etc., and (2) she appears to have sufficient funds to do this already, were it of any possible interest to her. And more money coming in all the time. She may well make more money telling people that they're eating yoga mats than I do trying to discover drugs.
