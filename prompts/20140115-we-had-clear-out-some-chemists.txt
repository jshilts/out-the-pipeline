"We Had to Clear Out Some Chemists"
15 Jan 2014

Matthew Herper at Forbes got a phone interview (http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2014/01/14/how-merck-is-mending-its-relationship-with-the-fda-hunting-for-deals-and-trying-to-move-forward/) in with Merck's Roger Perlmutter, and some interesting things came up: 
 Perlmutter has praised chemistry – the ability to synthesize new drug molecules, as one of Merck’s core strengths. Which is why rumors that he’s been laying off chemists came as a surprise. And the rumors are true. 
 “It is the case that we have a superb chemistry organization, and having coming back I’m impressed with the progress the chemistry organization has made in terms of the compositions of matter,” he says. In hepatitis C, in particular, he notes that molecule are 700 to 1,000 daltons, way bigger than the company would have previously considered using. But he says he needed to clear out some chemists to hire more biologists. 
 “The reality is, as every chemist knows, you need great biologists to identify where to focus and we need to strengthen our biology capabilities and that just requires a different kind of investment. and we need to make headroom — it’s kind of a zero sum game. I was not happy, I don’t want to fire people, but on the other hand I know we have to live within our means.” 
 It seems that he could drop the "kind of" in front of "zero sum game", if that's what's really going on (and it may well be). It's true that you can have the wrong balance of chemists to biologists, and you can have it in either direction. We can argue (and people do) about what the proper settings are, but I don't think that anyone would dispute that it's possible to go too far. Whether Merck's research organization was, in fact, that imbalanced is open to argument, too, of course. 
 But when I hear this sort of rationale, I can't help but think of Randall Jarrell's lines (http://books.google.com/books?id=CY_4EhBXayEC&pg=PA208&lpg=PA208&dq=jarrell+%22that's+what+they+tell+the+eggs%22&source=bl&ots=Rwd5VWtqyr&sig=visDIvf6Jviyk7RxUKoU25AyxsY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vnjWUuP-IPbNsQTIj4GoBw&ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=jarrell%20%22that's%20what%20they%20tell%20the%20eggs%22&f=false) : "You can't break eggs without making an omelette / - That's what they tell the eggs."
