Crowdfunding Independent Research
6 Feb 2014

I've written about Ethan Perlstein's work here before (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/10/05/crowdfunding_a_cns_project) , and now I note that the Wall Street Journal has an article (http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303743604579354831111502624?mg=reno64-wsj&url=/cms/10.1126/blog-post.3837/asset/http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702303743604579354831111502624.html) about his crowdfunding research model. 
 Ethan O. Perlstein for years followed a traditional path as a scientist. He earned a Ph.D. in molecular biology from Harvard, spent five years doing postdoctoral research at Princeton and led a team that published two papers on pharmacology. 
 But last year, Dr. Perlstein was turned down by 27 universities when he sought a tenure-track position to set up his own lab. Hundreds of candidates had applied for a small number of positions, the universities said, a situation made worse by cuts in federal research funding.. . . 
 . . .Still, Dr. Perlstein's approach is unusual because he isn't raising money to support a discrete project or product. "Ethan is doing basic research," said Jessica Richman, co-founder of Ubiome, a health and wellness startup that raised more than $350,000 through crowdfunding on a site called Indiegogo. "He is selling the idea that he is an independent scientist doing research." 
 Dr. Perlstein plans to launch his public appeal for Perlstein Lab this week on a site called AngelList. Perlstein Lab will focus on finding drugs to treat lysosomal storage diseases, in which cells fail to produce and recycle waste. The materials accumulate in cells and can cause a range of problems, including death. 
 Here's his profile page (https://angel.co/ethan-perlstein) on AngelList, which seeks money from what the SEC calls "qualified" investors (high net worth individuals). I think that's probably a good idea - anyone who's done "angel" type investments before will have a more realistic idea of the chance of any return (you'd hope). Crowdfunding research, in general, is something that interests me (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/05/14/crowdfunding_research) a great deal, although it's easy to think of potential problems.
