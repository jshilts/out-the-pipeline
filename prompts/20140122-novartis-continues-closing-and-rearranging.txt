Novartis Continues Closing and Rearranging
22 Jan 2014

Novartis says that it's cutting (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/novartiss-global-reorganization-hits-home-basel-rd-center/2014-01-21) about 500 positions in Switzerland, in what they're saying are support and pharma development roles. They're also closing a plant (http://www.lohud.com/article/20140121/NEWS02/301210058/Novartis-close-Suffern-plant-hundreds-affected) in Suffern, NY. The company is famously tight-lipped about this sort of thing, so there really aren't any details on whether this is a continuation of last year's rearrangements or what. More information if any shows up!
