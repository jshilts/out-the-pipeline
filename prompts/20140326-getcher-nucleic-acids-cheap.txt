Getcher Nucleic Acids, Cheap
26 Mar 2014

Via Nathaniel Comfort on Twitter (https://twitter.com/nccomfort/status/448631412451594240/photo/1) , I note that the health-food people are still selling "DNA supplements". I remember seeing these in a vitamin store some years ago, and wrinkling my brow as I thought about the implications. Does your food have enough DNA in it? Actually, these pills turn out to be 100mg of RNA and only 10mg of DNA, so you might want to adjust your dosages accordingly. 
 Turns out that the only negative review on the actual site (http://www.swansonvitamins.com/swanson-premium-rna-dna-100-10-mg-250-tabs) is from someone who's upset that there's so much filler in the pills themselves. More DNA is what he wants. He should try what another guy further down the page does, and swallow five of the things at a time. It gives him "energy", y'know, and he's not alone. Every one of these satisfied customers has felt the energy, and some of them even have picked up a healthy glow to their skin. So there you have it. I thought that peanut M&Ms gave me energy (although maybe not the healthy glow), but I should clearly start snacking on RNA instead. 
 When I called my wife with this news, her first comment was "RNA from what ?" I countered that a whole bottle of pills was only $4.99, and this was (brace yourselves) fifty per cent off the usual price. (In the reviews, one customer found this price very "exceptable"). Anyway, I said, this was not the time to be looking under the hood of such an opportunity. "And how much is shipping?" she wanted to know. I replied that I'm really not sure how I'm still married to her, what with that suspicious nature and all. I tell you.
