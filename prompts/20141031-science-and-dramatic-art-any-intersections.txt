Science And Dramatic Art: Any Intersections?
31 Oct 2014

Someone asked me this the other day, and I've never had a good answer for it. Has there ever been a realistic, compelling depiction of of what it's like to do scientific research in any movie, TV show, or play? My own answer is that while the number of dramatic works that have mishandled the subject are beyond counting, there are still many that manage to deal with scientific topics in a reasonable way. But how many of them are able to depict what it's actually like to be a scientist? 
 Perhaps the problem is that "realistic" and "compelling" are almost impossible to achieve at the same time for a wider audience. WIthout the background, you're at one remove (at least) to the real topic, and to the real experience. What happens is that the authors have to start out by saying, implicitly, "We'll stipulate that this is important. . .", or "Trust me, the protagonist finds this interesting. . .", and that's a big handicap to start off with. At least it is compared to the standard materials of human drama, which range from Shakespeare, Chekhov, etc. at the top to some sort of "Babies in Danger!" movie on the Lifetime channel at the bottom. 
 So most of the well-regarded depictions of science and scientists tend to borrow human interest in order to spice things up. There has to be conflict between strong personalities, a love story entanglement, or flat-out good guys and bad guys to give the audience someone to root for. It's true that there are episodes in scientific history that involve these things, but the science part of the story isn't about them. It's about ideas, and the manipulation of ideas is very, very hard to get across. (Montherlant said that "Happiness writes white", but scientific abstraction writes whiter than that). 
 It would be a wonderful thing if anyone could really make a reader or viewer feel what it was like to be an obscure patent clerk in Switzerland, surpassing Newton in your spare time. Or what it was really like for Watson and Crick when they heard that Linus Pauling had a DNA structure coming out, and when they then realized that it was wrong. Or what it must have been like for Alvarez and co-workers as the meaning of the iridium anomaly crept up on them. Or just what it's like for a grad student in chemistry, getting the result that means the definite end of their project and realizing that yes, this really is it. 
 But these are mental states, intimately tangled with a wealth of obscure details and high-level reasoning. They aren't built out of words, and their key steps aren't physical actions, so conveying them with words and physical actions is a major challenge. It's not possible to really get across what it must have been like to be Einstein. What sort of writer would you have to be? But just explaining things at one remove is hard, too: what sort of writer do you have to be to get across (say) the feeling of that self-referential tail-biting mathematical move that's at the heart of Gödel's incompleteness proof? To a reader who doesn't have much of any math? 
 And I've made it this far without even mentioning the other tough part, the pace at which these things move. Watson and Crick looped in and around the question of DNA structure for a couple of years before hitting on the solution - try turning that into a faithful hour-long TV special. Even without the mental gymnastics problem, those sorts of time courses are hard to dramatize. 
 But who's come closest? Nominations for artistic works of all kinds in the comments (TV, movies, books, plays), and in all fields of science. We're going to have to cast the net as widely as possible to come up with some good ones.
