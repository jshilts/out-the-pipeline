Atmospheric Conditions
23 Oct 2014

Well, I've been busy sciencing away all morning, and we're having the kind of weather outside that makes a person want to stay indoors and do chemistry: rainy, chilly, and windy. You wonder why more big chemical discoveries don't come out of the places that have these sorts of conditions all the time! 
 Air handling and climate control notwithstanding, this sort of weather naturally raises the humidity, and if I were having to worry about tiny moisture-sensitive reactions, these are not the conditions I would pick. But neither were the conditions back in the Southern US in the summertime - some afternoons down there, the humidity is like sticking your head into a dishwasher. How anyone managed to get chemistry done under those conditions in the days before air conditioning is a mystery to me. 
 My German lab, on my post-doc, was not air-conditioned (in keeping with much of the rest of the country) and had windows that opened, as very few other labs I've worked in ever have. But a German summer is not like an Arkansas one - in fact, every so often, a German summer can resemble an Arkansas winter. Even so, we did have to watch the air-sensitive reagents, because conditions certainly varied. My summer research in Arkansas, though, back when I was an undergrad, was conducted on the fourth floor of a building with no windows, so when the air conditioning went out there, we basically had to flee after a while. The plastic caps used on the old ether cans would come popping off in the heat, and that was a pretty good sign that it was time to pack it in for the day. 
 And my grad-school lab was also a windowless cave, thanks to the design of the building, but I really didn't get to experience un-air-conditioned chemistry in there. If the AC was down, it meant that the whole air handling system was messed up, which meant that the lab itself rapidly became uninhabitable. Decades of grad student-led contamination led to a pestilential funk that you could breast-stroke through; there was no way that I was going to hang around and experience it for any longer than I had to. 
 But all this is first-world complaining - I've had Indian colleagues, among others, describe really severe climate-influenced lab work. So feel free to add your worst examples in the comments, but expect the folks with experience in the tropics to win the competition!
