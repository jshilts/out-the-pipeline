 Well, the Discovery Channel has Shark Week, and apparently I have Sulfur Week going on around here. Or maybe it's Scripps Week (or Angewandte Chemie week), because here's the other paper (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201403758/abstract) from the Sharpless and Fokin labs on their new sulfonyl fluoride/sulfate ester chemistry (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/08/12/sulfur_fluoride_exchange) . This is the extension to polymers: if you take a scaffold that has two of the sulfonyl fluoride esters on it, and react that with another OTMS-bearing monomer, you get a rapid and clean polymerization to a polysulfate. 
 This is a structural class that has been only lightly investigated, because of synthetic difficulties, but it's now wide open. You don't often get to see a whole new area appear like this. It'll be interesting to see what properties these have as bulk materials, when spun into fibers, and so on. And since it's polymer chemistry, the only way to find these things out is to make them and see what you get. Right off, they look like more chemically resistant forms of polycarbonates, which would surely find some use, but there are probably many other uses waiting out there as well. 
 The broader point made by Sharpless in this paper and the previous one is that sulfates are under-used and under-explored as functional groups. I suspect that most organic chemists will have encountered only dimethyl sulfate in their careers, and that one is hardly representative of a whole universe of compounds. Biological molecules get sulfated around their edges in vivo , but I don't think that the disulfate esters are used biologically at all (anyone know of any examples?) There must be a good reason for that, but I certainly don't know what it is. (Frank Westheimer's classic "Why Nature Chose Phosphate" (http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~aathavan/libraire/whynaturechosephophates.pdf) is, as always, a good read in this area, but I don't think he considers sulfates in that paper). A more recent overview (http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/367/1602/2513.full) of the phosphorylation landscape also doesn't mention sulfates as an alternative, either. Phosphates clearly won out in the early days of biochemistry, but I don't know if that was all due to better thermodynamics, or availability (or both). 
 But as for organic synthesis, we can deal with all sorts of energy barriers, so there's no reason for us not to get some use out of sulfates. We just have to learn what they can do.
