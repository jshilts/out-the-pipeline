2014 Chemistry Nobel Predictions
29 Sep 2014

Well, we're getting close to the Nobel season, so it's time for the yearly (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/09/26/nobel_speculation_time) "Who's going to win?" post. According to (http://thomsonreuters.com/press-releases/092014/2014-nobel-laureates-predictions) Thomson Reuters, some favorites are Tan/van Slyke for organic light-emitting diodes, Moad/Rizzardo/Thang for RAFT polymerization, and Kresge/Ryoo/Stucky for mesoporous materials. You can see a real materials-science drift to those picks, which would indicate that the Thomson-Reuters folks think that we're not going to get another that's-not-chemistry-that's-biology award this year (nor one in analytical chemistry). 
 But if they're wrong about that, there are several things that shade over into molecular biology that are queued up. Some sort of prize for nuclear receptors would be plausible, and the CRISPR gene editing technology is surely in line for one. Another surely-that-will-win technique is optogenetics, the photoswitchable gene regulation method that's being used all over biology. They could always give it to Venter (et al.) for gene sequencing, or to Bruce Ames for the Ames test. As usual, these could end up in chemistry, or over in the physiology/medicine prize. In the zone where analytical chemistry blends into physics, there's single-molecule-spectroscopy and SPR. I don't see a flat-out organic chemistry prize in the works, but Sharpless is still plausible as part of a click-chemistry/chemical biology sort of award. 
 Other predictions can be found at Wavefunction's blog (http://wavefunction.fieldofscience.com/2014/09/its-most-wonderful-time-of.html) (he has a different top pick) and Everyday Scientist (http://blog.everydayscientist.com/?cat=56) . Add your own guesses to the comments section, and we'll see how wrong we all can be!
