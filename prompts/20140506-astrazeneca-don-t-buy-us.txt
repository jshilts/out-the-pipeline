AstraZeneca: Don't Buy Us
6 May 2014

After Pfizer's less-than-wonderful earnings report yesterday, AstraZeneca is out today painting a picture of how great things will be if they don't get swallowed by them. John Carroll at FierceBiotech has the details (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/astrazeneca-promises-investors-magnificent-future-without-pfizer/2014-05-06) , but I especially enjoyed his pithy comment on Twitter: "AZN made more promises today than I will ever see broken again."
