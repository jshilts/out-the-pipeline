Oxygenated Nanobubbles. For Real?
21 Oct 2014

A longtime reader sent along this article (http://www.dddmag.com/news/2014/10/revalesio%E2%80%99s-drug-has-potential-treat-alzheimer%E2%80%99s-disease?et_cid=4218769&et_rid=45533794&location=top) , just based on the headline. "This headline triggers instant skepticism in me", he said, and I agree. "Potential to treat Alzheimer's" is both a bold and a weaselly statement to make. The weasel part is that sure, anything has the "potential" to do that, but the boldness lies in the fact that so far, nothing ever has . There are a couple of very weak symptomatic treatments out there, but as far as actually addressing the disease, the clinical success rate is a flat zero. But that's not stopping these folks: 
 “The impact of RNS60 on Alzheimer’s disease as outlined in our studies presents new opportunities for hope and deeper research in treating a disease that currently cannot be prevented, cured or even successfully managed,” said Dr. Kalipada Pahan, professor of neurological sciences, biochemistry and pharmacology and the Floyd A. Davis, M.D., endowed chair of neurology at the Rush University Medical Center. “Our findings sparked tremendous excitement for RNS60, identifying an opportunity for advanced research to develop a novel treatment to help the rapidly increasing number of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia patients.” 
 Well, good luck to everyone. But what, exactly, is RNS60, and who is Revalesio, the company developing it? I started reading up on that, and got more puzzled the further I went. That press release described RNS60 as "a therapeutic saline containing highly potent charge-stabilized nanostructures (CSNs) that decrease inflammation and cell death." That didn't help much. Going to the company's web site (http://revalesio.com/about-our-technology/) , I found this: 
 Revalesio is developing a novel category of therapeutics for the treatment of inflammatory diseases using its proprietary charge-stabilized nanostructure (CSN) technology. Revalesio’s products are created using a patented device that generates rotational forces, cavitation and high-energy fluid dynamics to create unique, stable nanostructures in liquids. CSNs are less than 100 nanometers in size (for reference, the width of a single strand of hair is 100,000 nanometers) and are established through the combination of an ionic scaffold and a nano-sized oxygen bubble core. 
 RNS60 is Revalesio’s lead product candidate based upon CSN technology. RNS60 is normal, medical-grade, isotonic saline processed with Revalesio’s technology. RNS60 does not contain a traditional active pharmaceutical ingredient and offers a unique and groundbreaking approach to treating diseases . . . 
 OK, then. If I'm getting this right, this is saline solution with extremely small bubbles of oxygen in it. I'm not familiar with the "nanobubble" literature, so I can't say if these things exist or not. I'm unwilling to say that they don't, because lot of odd things happen down at that small scale, and water is a notoriously weird substance. The size of the bubbles they're talking about would be what, a few hundred oxygen molecules across? Even proving that these structures exist and characterizing them would presumably be a major challenge, analytically, but I have some more reading to do on all that. 
 My problem is that there have been many, many, odd water products reported over the years that involve some sort of nanostructure in the solution phase. And by "odd", I mean fraudulent. Just do a quick Google search for any combination of phrases in that area, and the stuff will come gushing out - all sorts of claims about how the water being sold is so, so, different, because it has different clusters and layers and what have you. My second problem is that there have been many, many odd products reported over the years that claim to be some sort of "oxygenated" water. Do a Google search for that, but stand back, because you're about to be assaulted by page after page of wild-eyed scam artists. Super-oxygen miracle water has been a stable of the health scam business for decades now. 
 So the Revalesio people have a real challenge on their hands to distinguish themselves from an absolute horde of crackpots and charlatans. The web site says that these oxygen nanobubbles "have a stabilizing effect on the cell membrane", which modulates signaling of the PI3K pathway. The thing is, there are a number of publications on this stuff, in real journals, which is not the sort of thing you find for your typical Internet Wonder Water. The president of the company is a longtime Eli Lilly executive as well, which is also rather atypical for the fringe. Here's one (http://www.jbc.org/content/early/2012/06/29/jbc.M111.338012.abstract) from J. Biol. Chem., and here's one (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp310513v?prevSearch=sean%2Bgerman&searchHistoryKey=) on nanoparticle handing from the Journal of Physical Chemistry . The current neuronal protection work is in two papers in PLOS ONE, here (http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0103606) and here (http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0051869) . 
 I'm baffled. These papers talk about various cellular pathways being affected (PI3K, ATP production, phosphorylation of tau, NF-kb activation, and so on), which is a pretty broad range of effects. It's a bit hard to see how something with such effects could always be positive, but paper after paper talks about benefits for models of Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, exercise physiology, and now Alzheimer's. A common thread could indeed be inflammation pathways, though, so I can't dismiss these mechanisms out of hand. But then there's this paper (http://jap.physiology.org/content/114/12/1736.abstract?sid=8a80bb55-6833-4291-92fe-42bde3e8d59a) , which says that drinking this water after exercise improves muscle recovery, and I'm just having all kinds of trouble picturing how these nanostructured bubbles make it intact out of the gut and into the circulation. If they're sticking all over cell membranes, don't they do that to every cell they come in contact with? Are there noticeable effects in the gut wall or the vascular endothelium? What are the pharmacokinetics of nanobubbles of oxygen, and how the heck do you tell (other than maybe a radiolabel?) I'm writing this blog entry on the train, where I don't have access to all these journal articles, but it'll be interesting to see how these things are addressed. (If I were running a program like this one, and assuming that my head didn't explode from all the cognitive dissonance, I'd be trying it out in Crohn's and IBD, I think - or do all the nanobubbles get absorbed before they make it to the colon?) 
 So I'm putting this out there to see if everyone else gets the same expressions on their faces as I do when I look this over. Anyone have any more details on this stuff?
