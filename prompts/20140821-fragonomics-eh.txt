Fragonomics, Eh?
21 Aug 2014

Edward Zartler ("Teddy Z" of the Practical Fragments (http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/) blog) has a short piece (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ml5003212) in the latest ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters on fragment-based drug discovery. He applies the term "fragonomics" to the field (more on this in a moment), and provides a really useful overview of how it should work. 
 One of his big points is that fragment work isn't so much about using smaller-than-usual molecules, as it is using molecules that make only good interactions with the target. . It's just that smaller molecules are far more likely to achieve that - a larger one will have some really strong interactions, along with some things that actually hurt the binding. You can start with something large and hack pieces of it off, but that's often a difficult process (and you can't always recapitulate the binding mode, either). But if you have a smaller piece that only makes a positive interaction or two, then you can build out from that, tiptoeing around the various landmines as you go. That's the concept of "ligand efficiency", without using a single equation. 
 He also emphasizes that having a simpler molecule to work on means that the SAR can be tested and expanded quickly, often without anyone hitting the lab bench at all. You can order things up from the vendors or raid your own screening collection for close analogs. This delays the entry of the medicinal chemists to the project, which (considering that their time is always in demand) is a feature to be happy about. 
 The article ends up by saying that "Fragonomics has won the field. . .The age of the medchemist is over; now is the time of the biophysicist. " I don't know if that's quite the way to win friends and influence people, though. Medicinal chemists are rather sensitive to threats to their existence (with good reason), so my worry is that coming on like this will make chemists who haven't tried it leery of fragment-based drug design in general. I'm also not thrilled with "fragonomics" as a term (just as I'm not thrilled with most of the newly-coined "omics" terms). The word doesn't add anything; it's just a replacement for having to say "fragment-based drug discovery" or "FBDD" all the time. It's not that we don't need a replacement for the unwieldy phrase - it's just that I think that many people might (by now) be ready to dismiss anything that's had "omics" slapped on it. I wish I had something better to offer, but I'm coming up blank myself.
