The Deadly Stupidities Around Ebola
26 Sep 2014

It's not all that often that you can say "Now this is a person who's going to get people killed". But I'm willing to say that about Cyril Broderick of Delaware State. He's Liberian-born, and has written an article for a newspaper in Monrovia telling Liberians (http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/09/26/an-american-professor-is-telling-liberians-that-the-u-s-manufactured-ebola-outbreak/?tid=hp_mm&hpid=z3) that the Ebola virus is a manufactured bioweapon from the pharmaceutical companies and the US Department of Defense. And he goes on to say the the WHO, Doctors Without Borders, and the CDC are all in on the plot. Isn't that nice? 
 This in a region where suspicions run so high that doctors, officials, and aid workers are being killed by angry mobs already (http://www.vox.com/2014/9/24/6838507/red-cross-attacked-in-guinea-while-working-to-fight-ebola-virus) . Now Prof. Broderick has given his Liberian countrymen more reason to fear some of the people who are best equipped, of anyone on this suffering world, to actually help them. If GSK's Ebola vaccine actually proves effective, if a rapacious evil pharma company actually comes up with a way to stop the disease (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2014/09/17/pharma_and_ebola) and turns it over to people like the WHO and Doctors Without Borders to go into West Africa and administer it, stuff like what Professor Broderick is spewing will make it that much harder to accomplish anything with it. People will hide rather than get vaccinated and attack the people coming in to save their lives. Broderick and Matthias Rath (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias_Rath) , who's urged HIV patients to throw away (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2005/06/09/dr_rath_does_what_he_can) their retroviral drugs, are in the same category and I am ashamed to be on the same planet with them. 
 And all because of a bunch of stuck-together conspiracy theories, chew-toys for halfwits. It would be easier to laugh at if it weren't getting people killed, patients and medical workers alike. Schiller was right: against stupidity, the Gods themselves fight in vain.
