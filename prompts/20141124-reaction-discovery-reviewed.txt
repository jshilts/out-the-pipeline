Reaction Discovery Reviewed
24 Nov 2014

I've written (http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/v6/n10/full/nchem.2062.html) several times (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2013/04/05/more_reaction_discovery) here about (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/06/19/a_new_reaction_discovery_platform) reaction discovery techniques (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2012/05/09/more_reaction_discovery_now_with_antibody_detection) , going back (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2011/11/30/finding_even_more_new_reactions_by_looking_for_them) to 2011 (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2011/09/21/finding_new_reactions_by_looking_for_them) . And I've been meaning to link to this recent review (http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/v6/n10/full/nchem.2062.html) in Nature Chemistry , because it's an excellent summary of the field and the relevant literature. If you're at all interested in the topic of combinatorial reaction-searching and new methods development, you really should have a look - as far as I can see, it's comprehensive.
