ACS Webinars on Drug Discovery
24 Feb 2014

I wanted to mention the ACS Webinar series on Drug Discovery (http://acswebinars.org/drug-discovery) , which will be going on every so often throughout the year. I'm going to be doing the introductory overview one, along with Rick Connell of Pfizer and Nick Meanwell of BMS, this Thursday, 2PM to 3PM EST. As you'll note from the schedule, there are plenty more of these coming up that go into more detail, so we're going to be setting the stage and taking questions from the audience.
