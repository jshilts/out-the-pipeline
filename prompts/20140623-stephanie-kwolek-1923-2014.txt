I have that story as an entry in my manuscript for "The Chemistry Book" (one of several polymer chemistry entries). What the organic chemists in the crowd might not realize is that one of Kwolek's key steps in the discovery was the use of a solvent that would actually dissolve the aromatic amide polymer for it to be spun. As you'd imagine, it's not the most soluble stuff in the world, but HMPA did the trick. 
 The response from today's lab bench would be "HMPA?", with a couple of raised eyebrows. That solvent, though powerful indeed, is now recognized (http://books.google.com/books?id=6ld0K9VNpmIC&pg=PA572&lpg=PA572&dq=kevlar+hmpa&source=bl&ots=5YH5i6MgwG&sig=JWKR5vHweHbVWzOmVVfzqNhs4gc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MxuoU8aBI9alqAaiz4CICQ&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=kevlar%20hmpa&f=false) to be a carcinogen, and you don't see it around the lab as much as you used to. DuPont's own toxicology department helped to recognize the problem, and the switch to an alternate solvent (N-methylpyrrolidone, I believe) was eventually made, at no small expense. Part of that expense was patent-related: Akzo Nobel in particular had arrived at processes for producing aramid fibers with that less toxic solvent, so there were legal fireworks as well. 
 Kwolek's HMPA solution didn't look promising even after she'd made it, though. It was too mobile and watery-looking for the folks in the next department to think that it was going to spin into fibers, but she finally persuaded someone to try it. To everyone's surprise, it made terrific fibers whose strength was off the scale of some of the testing equipment. Kevlar and other aramid fibers are famously used in bulletproof vests and Kwolek herself had many interactions over the years with police officers whose lives had been saved. The aramid fibers as a class show up in all sorts of test-of-strength applications, such as tires, brake linings, lightweight composite materials, flame-resistant clothing, boat hulls and so on.
