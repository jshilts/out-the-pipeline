Too many foreigners in your drug company? Outsiders being put into positions of power and influence, threatening the entire firm's culture? That's the objection (http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/takeda-taken-task-hiring-so-many-foreigners/2014-06-20) that many Takeda employees seem to have to the company's recent tendency (unusual in Japan, to say the least) of bringing in many non-Japanese hires at all levels. The Financial Times broke the story (http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/bdf8abd2-f84c-11e3-a333-00144feabdc0.html#axzz35TJzyUbH) in the English-language press: 
 In a letter to Takeda Pharmaceutical, 110 former executives and individual investors questioned the company’s appointment of non-Japanese to several senior positions. 
 “The company’s globalisation is a wrong globalisation. It should be globalised as a Japanese company. However, from the top to the bottom ,there are hundreds of non-Japanese working in the company in Japan,” said Yujiro Hara, a former head of Takeda’s real estate subsidiary who represents the group. 
 “We say it was acquired by a foreign capital. We cannot accept it,” he added. “Three main executive positions, finance, HR and purchase, are taken by foreigners.” 
 This is not a large group, in terms of shares held, but they're certainly a vocal one, and they may well represent what some others are feeling. Japan is its own place, maybe more so than anywhere else in the high-tech industrialized world, and this is a fine example of it. Try to imagine a letter like this in the US!
