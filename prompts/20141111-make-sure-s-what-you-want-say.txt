Make Sure That's What You Want to Say
11 Nov 2014

You want to be careful when you add comments to manuscripts, you know. Sometimes your patent application will publish with all the legal back-and-forthing still in it (https://www.science.org/pipeline/2009/08/05/how_not_to_do_it_the_secret_patent_decoder_ring) . (There was an even more egregious example of this in an electronics patent application about ten years ago, but I'm having trouble putting my hands on it - someone at the law department had comments in the claims like "Not sure if we can claim this!") 
 Journal manuscripts can publish with this sort of thing, too. Don't assume that someone will catch, say, something like thisL 

OMG- This paper got published with this highlighted phrase and no-one noticed? http://t.co/GxMTSCVBBO (http://t.co/GxMTSCVBBO) pic.twitter.com/CN4aKa0Daw (http://t.co/CN4aKa0Daw) — Eze Gleichgerrcht (@e_gleich) November 11, 2014 (https://twitter.com/e_gleich/status/531999058370777089) 

The "show comments" and "track changes" functions haven't ruined quite as many careers as the "reply all" button, but they have their moments. One example of the latter I remember from a former company was one of those farewell e-mails - you know, it's been great working with all of you over the past few years, etc. Someone sent one of those out to a gigantic list of people at the company, including many of the higher-ups, and a poor soul did a Reply To All saying something like "Take me with you! I wish I were getting out of this place, too!" Whoops. I often wondered if they got their chance sooner than they expected, after that. . .
