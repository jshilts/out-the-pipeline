Get the Science Out of Your Yogurt
5 Jun 2014

Some readers may have seen the yogurt containers that advertise their low calorie count with the slogan "Nature got us to 100 calories. Not scientists. #howmatters." I was thinking of ripping into for that, but I see that this piece (http://www.popsci.com/article/science/yogurt-maker-chobani-sick-scientists-ruining-everything) at Popular Science has done an excellent job of that (and there are others). 
 Yeah, I'm sure that a nationally distributed yogurt company ignores food science. They don't hire anyone who knows about shelf stability, reproducibility of ingredient sources, industrial fermentation, mixing effects, scale-up, sterilization of equipment, or any of that boring sciencey stuff. They just trust to nature, because what's more natural than fleets of 18-wheel trucks hauling loads of yogurt around in plastic cups? And the little aluminum lid that you peel off to find that idiotic slogan on it - they find those out in the meadow, just down from the herd of cows who give pasteurized milk. 
 The slogan itself is annoying, but what gets me more are the attitudes behind it. First, of course, is the "Science = icky" assumption, which seems to be just taken for granted by whoever wrote this thing. Its author also trusted everyone who read it to make the same connection, which isn't too comforting, either. But at another level, there's a really cynical outlook here, one that is somewhat at odds with the company's gosh-we're-so-natural image. Someone higher-up OKed this slogan, in full knowledge that the company's yogurt is produced - has to be produced - on an industrial scale, in a factory with lots of stainless steel equipment. But what the hell - sounds good, and people will buy it. The sorts of people who are favorably impressed by a slogan like that can be sold all sorts of stuff. They're valuable customers, and you want to tell them things that make them happy, whether they're true or not.
