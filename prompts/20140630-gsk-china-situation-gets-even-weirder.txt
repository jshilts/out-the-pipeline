The GSK-China Situation Gets Even Weirder
30 Jun 2014

OK, the GlaxoSmithKline/China business has officially crossed over into new territory. Over the weekend, the company confirmed reports (http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/30/glaxosmithkline-china-sex-tape) that Mark Reilly, the GSK executive in the country who's been in the middle of this affair from the beginning, was the object of a blackmail attempt by unknown parties. (The story was broken by the Sunday Times , and it's behind a paywall, but it's been picked up by every major news outlet). 
 Someone shot extensive footage of Reilly alone with his Chinese girlfriend, and mailed the resulting file to higher-ups at the company. The connection between all this and the corruption allegations has not been made clear, but the footage apparently accompanied some of the emails accusing the company of bribery. We may never know quite what's going on here, but I'll bet it's very interesting indeed.
